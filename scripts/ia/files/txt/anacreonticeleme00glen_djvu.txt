An abstract of 

The anacreontic Element in Goethe’s 

Early Lyric x-oetry 


a tiiesis of 215 pages 
by 

G-. R. Giilard 

Goethe’s first two collections of poetry, the 
’Annette Lieder’ and the Neue lieder contain a markedly 
anacreontic element. Although the anacreontic tradition 
originated with the Greek lyricist Anacreon and was continued 
by the Pseudoanacreontics and by French, English, Spanish 
and Italian poets, it was the seventeenth century German 
Anacreontics, Hagedorn, Gleim, Gdtz and Uz who influenced 
the young Goethe most strongly* This influence appears in 
the ’Annette Lieder’ as the repetition of a few conventional 
motifs having to do chiefly with love, the use of a 
restricted and trite vocabulary which stresses the senses, 
a ’playing with feeling’ and the presentation of almost 
unbelievable love scenes in pastoral settings. 

In the I.eue Lieder Goerhe has almost completely 
abandoned the anacreontic attitude to love and nature, as 
well as the conventional vocabulary. The majority of the

themes are unconventional and more reflective and the language 
is strikingly original, especially when Goethe symbolizes 
nature. The poems in the heue nieder express, on the whole, 
his own feeling and are based on his own experience. 

Sven these early works, which are modelled to a 
large extent on contemporary writers, reveal Goethe's 
creative genius and point clearly to the developing poet.

INTRODUCTION 





1 


Greece has often been regarded as the cradle of culture 
and civilization as we know it today* In the field of painting, 
architecture and sculpture the Hellenes created magnificent 
works of art which we still admire for their splendour and 
beauty* The speculations of the ancient philosophers, primarily 
Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, have given the impetus to and 
laid the foundation of philosophical thinking throughout the 
centuries. Ho less important has been the stimulating effect 
of such poets as Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides on the 
development of drama and theatre. In addition to these 
luminaries many lesser lights have played an important part 
in the evolution of human thinking and have become the models 
of many of our poets and philosophers. One of these minor 
figures is the Greek lyric poet Anacreon, whose charming and 
convivial poems attracted imitators not only among his own 
countrymen, but also among French, English, Italian, Spanish 
and German writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 
Of all these earlier and later T Anacreontics*, young Johann 
Wolfgang Goethe was the most genial and the most significant. 

It is the purpose of this thesis to try to determine 
to what extent Anacreon and the Anacreontics have influenced 
Goethe*s first literary-attempts, his Annette Lieder and his 
Neue Lieder . As a result of this investigation we should 
also be able to ascertain whether these poems contain evidences 
of Goethe*s own feelings.

Before we analyse the poems of these two collections as 
to their anacreontic features, we must devote some space to 
Anacreon and his most important imitators. By this method 
we will he able later to recognize more clearly Goethe f s grow¬ 
ing independence from his models.

ANACREON 


Water bring, and bring me wine,

Anacreon was born about 572 B.C. in Teos, an Ionian 

town on the northern shore of the Gaystrian Gulf of Greece, 

When he was twenty-seven, the Persians invaded his homeland 

i) 

and tie fled to Abdera in Thrace. From here his fame as a 

lyric poet reached Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, who 

summoned him to his court, which at that time was one of the 

gayest and most flourishing in Asia. Shortly afterward 

Polycrates was assassinated and Anacreon was left without a 

patron. Upon hearing of this, Hipparchus invited him to Athens 

and, according to legend, sent a vessel of fifty oars to escort 

2 ) 

him over the Aegean. During an uprising several years later 

his fortunes fell with the ruling party and Anacreon was forced 

to flee again to Thrace. He lived here peacefully until his 

eighty-fifth year, when, it is said, he choked to death upon 

3) 

a grape stone while sampling some new wine. Although the 
veracity of this story is highly dubious, it shows what posterity 
thought of him. 

Anacreon has had the singular fate of becoming famous in 

modern times chiefly for poems which were not composed until 

4 } 

centuries after he was dead. His imitators have created the

impression that he was at best a senile and bilious old man and 

at worst a shameless debauchee. His real personality, however, 

emerges distinctly from the fifteen pages of fragments of his 

works which have escaped the malice of time. He wanted to enjoy 

life and he made no secret about it. He took care to avoid 

anything strenuous and spent half a century decking himself 

1 ) 

with garlands and singing of love and wine. He was remarkably 

uninhibited when dealing with matters of sex or drink and yet, 

paradoxically, some of his best poetry calls for moderation in 

drinking. Knowing that over-indulgence could destroy pleasure, 

2 ) 

he took the golden mean as his motto. He hated war and was 
not afraid to say so in an age when fighting was glorified. 

Jovial and amiable, he was the ideal companion, for he kept to 
the end his matchless good humor. 

No other early Greek poet confined himself to so narrow a 

field - singing the praises of love and wine. In fact, an epigram 

3) 

assigned him the "triple worship" of the Muses, wine and love. 
These topics, however, were the best suited to his medium - 
light songs to be sung at banquets. The circles in which he 
moved embodied the f Ionian way of life 1 2 3 which the rest of the 
Greek empire regarded with moral disapproval combined with

admiration for its elegance. 

Anacreon’s favorite themes center around the enjoyment 

of life. He could imagine no sight more pleasant than a 

gathering of jolly fellows handing round the bowl of wine. He, 

too, wanted to join the merrymaking and his most frequent 

request was for wine: 

Come, a wassail I would keep, 

Drinking pledges flagon-deep 2) 

Pour me wine, five measures, lad. 

This is the realm of Dionysus, god of the grape, whom Anacreon 

praises very prettily. Some say that wine dulls the brain but, 

according to Anacreon, it stimulates the senses. But it could 

also be misused. All too often a thin line separated a feast 

from a brawl. Anacreon despised the sottishness and uncouthness 

which resulted, as barbaric. He summed up the proper, civilized 

way to conduct a banquet in these words: 

Drink, good fellows, drink no more 
With a clutter and uproar; 


Gentlemen observe a mean, 3) 

Tippling with good songs between. 

He called for moderation in all things and scorned ease, riches 
and position. His aim was to live out the golden mean in every¬ 
thing he did. Strangely enough his imitators either failed to 
grasp this point or else purposely avoided it. They could not

see any serious thought in his work because it was cloaked in 
a graceful tone. 

In one passage there is a skeleton at the feast. Anacreon 

laments that he is getting old and gray and toothless. He 

realizes with a start that he has little time left to ”taste 

1 ) 

the joy of living”. This theme of the shortness of life 
recurred very frequently in his writing. He sobbed and sighed 
when he thought what awaited him in the after-life. But it was 
not a very despairing sob for he did not believe in taking 
himself too seriously. 

Anacreon sang of his other major theme, love, in the same 

way. He seemed to be always on the point of laughing at himself. 

He never treated his emotions as if they were all that mattered. 

Much of his love poetry may be summed up in his own words: 

Again I am in love and not in love, am mad 
and not mad. 1 2 3 ^ 

He treated love as a trifle and in fact played with the idea of 

dying from love, threatening to fling himself into the ocean: 

Again I climb up and dive from the White Cliff 
into the hoary sea, intoxicated by love. ' 

Anacreon was not one of those who die for love and it is probable 

that the cliffs, which he celebrated, never killed anyone - at

least not for being a lover. 


Anacreon gave the classical approach to love a new twist 
which has since been imitated by countless writers. The follow¬ 
ing lines might be his credo: 

I wish to sing of the delicious Eros, the 
god with abundant floral crowns. He is the-, \ 
master of the gods, the subduer of mankind. 

This, so to speak, represents Anacreon's creed and is also a 

favorite theme. On the throne of the great Zeus, half serious 

and half smiling, luxurious Eros sits and ‘plays' king of the 

world. But as a king he is powerful and not without majesty. 

Gone is the fearsome deity. Anacreon replaces him with a 

sportive, kingly lad who playfully vexes the poet: 

Once more the Lad with golden hair 
His purple ball across the air 
Flings at me, true to aim; 

And light her broidered slippers go, 

That Lesbian lass - my playfellow 
As love would set the game. ' 

Anacreon has brought emotion down to the common level of 

experience. 


True to the tradition of Greek poetry, Anacreon regarded 

love itself as something dangerous and destructive. He realized 

3) 

that the "toys of Eros are delirium and insanity." Love is

a force stronger than the individual. Once under its spell, he 
can never escape: 

Love, like a smith, again smote me with a 
great axe and soused me in a wintery torrent. 

This idea reappears as the theme of the power of love before 

which even fate has to give way. This is true love and can 

not be purchased with money. Not all love affairs, however, 

were of such a permanent nature. In fact Anacreon frequently 

sang of disappointment in love. General3.y he loses the girl 

to a younger man: 

My hair mislikes her, grown so white; 

There f s someone lovelier in her sight 
Who draws that callow gaze. ' 

Although we find it hard to believe today, Anacreon championed 
friendship among men only a little less than love between men 
and women. He refers again and again to "good comrades" and 
"true companions". This spirit of companionship apparently 
brought with it a feeling of well being which physical love 
could not quite equal. 

Not all of Anacreons poetry is straightforward and 
innocent. A few? of his songs have a second meaning. But even 
these are saved from sensuality by their grace and wit. His 
lyrics as a vHiole characterize the refinement of court life. 
They are exquisite in finish, delicately voluptuous in tone,

with a few excursions into more vigorous themes, some of which 
are satirical. His metre is simple and his thought as clear 
as his language. 

In recapitulation, Anacreon’s themes are very limited. 
The main ideas may be stated thus: Let us drink and love for 
who can tell when Death will bid us taste and love no more. 

The other motifs are offshoots of the double theme of love and 
wine. These are the shortness of life, the loss of youth, 
dread of death, praise of fraternal friendship, the need for 
temperance, the magic power of love, disappointment in love 
and praise of gods or goddesses. Anacreon hardly merits the 
epithet of wine, women and song which has clung to him, but he 
does deserve to be called the poet of sensuous pleasure.

THE ANACREONTBA

For ere to join I go 
The rout below, 

I fain would banish care. 

*— Let * s Drink and Love . Anacreontea , 
(Fragment 32) 







12 


About the third century B.C. it became a fashionable 
literary exercise to compose, in the name of Anacreon, little 
verses on the theme of wine and love. These Hellenistic and 
Byzantine imitators overemphasized the erotic and bibulous 
element in Anacreon f s lyrics, and substituted sugary frivolity 
for the graceful freshness of the original. These verses of 
love and wine came to be known as the Anacreontea although 
there is no evidence that they were conscious forgeries of the 
true Anacreon f s style and themes. The collection was relatively 
unknown until 1554, when Stephanus, a French printer, published 
it and a few of the originals as genuine works of the Ionian 
master. Not until late in the eighteenth century did scholars 
question the authenticity of these poems and investigate their 
ownership. 

The poems themselves offer conclusive proof that they 
are not the work of Anacreon. Nor are they the work of one 
single admirer. Anacreon wrote in the Ionic dialect but both 
grammar and vocabulary of these poems feature many non-ionic 

i) 

expressions. Furthermore they do not refer to details in 

2) 

Anacreon f s life and are rarely quoted by the Ancients. 

They differ also in verse structure. They are not composed 
in the variety of Greek lyric measures but in a monotony of

tripping iambics. In these lyrics Bacchus is referred to as 

Lyaeus and Aphrodite as Gythera, but this terminology did 

1 ) 

not come into use until the Alexandrian Age. None of the 
poems is written for one definite occasion. They are just 
’pretty pieces’ to be sung by anybody, at any time. After 
reading the Anacreontea we are struck by its slightness and 
prettiness compared with Anacreon’s simplicity and beauty. 

One of the favorite pseudoanacreontic motifs is that 

of love-sickness. We do not know whether the lover succumbed 

2) 3) 

to a pair of dark eyes or if Eros dealt him a mortal blow. 

At any rate his sickness is very real. His head throbs, his 

tongue is swollen and his pulse races. As the fever increases 

his breathing becomes more and more labored. The end appears 

to be in sight. Only little Eros can take away the pain which 

he has inflicted. Fortunately he is in good spirits and 

willing to oblige. He strikes the patient’s forehead with 

4) 

his wing and the latter recovers instantly. The outcome is, 
however, not always so pleasant. As long as Eros arrives in 
time to effect a cure, no harm is done. But he is a moody 
elf and is often so caught up in his own fancies that one 
cannot rely on him to undo the harm his arrows have caused.

One poem, for instance , tells the sad tale of a glen inhabited 

1) 

by poor shrieking creatures whom love has driven mad. 


In these poems the lover is not a bold youth who fights 

for his lady’s favor but a sentimental dreamer. As a rule 

these dreams take the form of day-dreams or wishes which do 

not stimulate the young man to realize them. In one poem he 

wishes to be his lady f s mirror, her clothing, perfume for her 

2 ) 

hair, a pearl for her throat or a sandal for her foot. An 

air of languidness runs through the Anacreontea which is 

lacking in Anacreon’s verses. In two poems, which remind us 

of Gleim’s Per Vermittler , the lover calls on an artist to paint 

his love’s portrait, while he is content to sit by and describe 

3 ) 

her charms. Little energy is used up in this kind of court¬ 
ing. One poem, however, seems to contradict this generalization 

for in it the poet sings of his countless conquests which seem 

4 ) 

to range over all the Mediterranean area. This motif of the 
listing of sweethearts appears again in Gleim’s Die Revue . 


The Pseudoanacreontics delighted in relating the 

adventures of Eros. One poem tells how he races to his mother 

Venus screaming: "Alas, I’m dying", after having been stung by 
t>) 

a bee. When in a more cheerful mood he plaits a wreath of

roses for his hair and goes dancing with the three Graces. 

Or else he joins forces with Bacchus, the Wine god and, 

2) 

putting on an apron, serves wine to the reclining guests. 

His vanity and curiosity often get him into trouble. On one 

occasion he either falls or is dropped into a cup of wine 

and quaffed down by the tippler. At another time he loses 

his way and begs shelter at the poet’s house. In reward for 

his kindness, playful Eros wounds the poet with one of his 

4 ) 

darts. During another of his adventures the Muses capture 

5 ) 

him and bind him with vines. From these adventures we 
conclude that Eros is a spoiled but charming elf. But when 
aroused he is an artful rascal. In one poem we learn that: 

6 ) 

"great Mars with massy spear.flouted Love’s puny gear." 

Eros demands a battle on the spot but Mars retracts his 
hasty words when he learns that Eros has dipped his arrows 
in gall instead of in honey. The German Anacreontics and 
Goethe seem to have relied upon the Anacreontea almost 
exclusively when portraying Amor. Uz, for example, 
incorporates the motif of ’Eros’ capture’ into his An Galatee 
and the motif of ’Eros lost’ in his Per verlorene Amor.

Goethe, too, borrows the motif of ’Eros in the wine 1 2 3 and the 
’love battle’. 


The motif of the rose is closely tied up with the theme 

of love; the rose is the symbol of love which appears most 

frequently. Nearly every mention of it carries the connotation 

of spring, new life and new love. According to one poem the 

young man twines roses around his brow when he is in the mood 

1) 

for love. Or else he mingles rose petals with the wine to 

make it more fragrant. The perfume of the rose cannot help 

but induce love, for it is "God’s darling, mortal’s joy, 

2 ) 

Great Venus’ toy”. In fact, according to another poem 

Jove created Venus and the rose at the same moment: 

When wet from the blue sea 
Game Venus, when Jove’s head 
Brought forth the War-Lady 
That was Heav’n’s dread, 

Then too first bloomed from out the earth 
This cunning work, this marvellous birth. 


The purpose of life is to enjoy oneself, or so sang 
the Pseudoanacreonties. Their idea of enjoyment is, however, 
quite simple. They ask only for a little red wine, a 
wreath of roses and a few true comrades. They want neither 
wealth nor power. This is essentially the same idea that 


1) Edmonds, E legy and Iambus , p .77 • 

2) » p.89. 

3) Ibid ., p.91. 









17 


the German Anacreontics and later Goethe put forward. Wine 

is essential to the enjoyment of life because it speeds the 

i) 

course of love. Wine, it is also claimed, dulls the 

2) 

intellectual faculties and lulls cares to sleep. Furthermore, 

according to one writer, wine contains remarkable rejuvenating 

qualities. After the wine bowl has been handed around a few 

times, a doddering old man totters to his feet and mumbles: 

I f m old, in sooth, 

But I can outdrink youth. 


Fetch Bacchus juice, and you 
Shall see what age can do. 1 2 3 4 5 ' 


While the wine flows, the carousers fill the air with 

praises of Bacchus, the god of wine. The Pseudoanacreontics 

credited this god with far wider powers than did Anacreon. 

According to one poem he is also the god of the dance for he 

"invented the measure". The same poem maintains, that as 

"true lover of the lyre" he first cultivated the art of song. 

In short, it is claimed that he is the source of all 

pleasure in the world: 

He gave the Wassail birth 
And midwived Mirth, 

Killed Pain, and Sorrihed 
Did put to bed. 3 '

But Bacchus * power is limited to this world only. What 

happens after death is beyond his control. As we can expect, 

the feverish cry 'Enjoy yourself while you can' runs through 

many poems. One tippler, for example, puts it bluntly: "I'd 

1) 

rather lie drunk than dead"* In another poem a group of 

ladies make fun of Anacreon's thinning locks. Anacreon 

himself is supposed to reply: "The nigher Death's day, the 

2 ) 

more should old men play". Elsewhere the poet tries to 

laugh off the fear of death and to treat the whole situation 

practically. Why, he asks, should one waste precious myrrh 

on the dead? Let it be given to the livii^ who can appreciate 

3 ) 

its fragrance. Gleim echoes the same sentiment in his 
Befehl an die Erben. 


The Pseudoanacreontics did not try to infuse real life 

into their nature scenes. Like Anacreon, they praised 

nature's beauty and variety, but only in so far as it 

fonned a background for love: 

0 merry 'tis to stray 

Where meads are green and gay, 

And where the gentle West 
Blows sweetliest. 

To see the mantling vine 
And 'neath its leaves recline

As already mentioned, the favorite flower is the rose because 

of the legend of its origin* Spring is the most glorious 

season of all. One poet sings of the swallow but only 

2 ) 

because its twittering disturbs his dreams of love* This 

poem is clearly the forerunner of Gleim’s An die Hausschwalbe * 

3l 

Another sings of the dove who serves Anacreaon* The dove 

delights so much in sipping from his master’s cup, pecking 

at his bread and clapping his wings in time to his verses, 

that he forsakes nature* Even if Anacreon were to set him 

free, he would not return to the forest, but would remain 

his courier for ever. The most charming poem about nature 

4) 

is entitled To the Cricket * Here the poet toasts the 
chirper of the field who is beloved of Apollo and the Muses 
because of his sweet voice. Man loves him too because he 
announces the springtime and love. Nature does not inspire 
the poet to express his inneimost feelings. On the contrary, 
it makes him think of love in such stereotyped terms as 
Eros and roses.

literary worth of the poems of the Anacreontea . We are 
interested in them in so far as they have been the models 
for later writers, particularly the German Anacreontics. 

We may summarize the motifs of the Anacreontea which have 
had the greatest influence on later writers as follows: 

Eros swallowed in a draft of wine; drink, my comrades; the 
poet's countless loves; to a swallow; all creatures drink, 
why not I; I would I were thy mirror; the rose; and Eros, the 
lost child admitted from the storm who rewards his benefactor 
with a shaft from his bow.

CHAPTER III 


FRENCH, ENGLISH, ITALIAN AND 


SPANISH AN ACRE ONT ICS* 


Tendre fruit des pleurs de l f Aurore, 
Ob jet des baisers du Z^piiir, 

Reine de 1*empire de Flora, 

Hgte-toi de t*6panouir. 

— Da Rose by Gent!I Bernard 





The Anacreontea exercised a wide influence on European 


literature in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth 

centuries. Its influence was first felt in France. Only- 

two years after Stephanus printed the collection in 1554, 

1 ) 

Belleau translated it into French. In his attempt to 

introduce the classical style into French literature, the 

poet Ronsard, too, was strongly influenced by Homer, Pindar 

and Anacreon and wrote many lyrics in the style of the latter, 

as for example the following: 

Ma petite colombelle, 

Ma petite toute belle, 

Mon petit oeil, baisez-moyl 
D*une bouche'toute pleine 
D*amours, chassez moy la peine 
De mon amoureux esmoy. 1 2 3 ' 

During the Classical Period of the seventeenth century, French 
authors turned to greater G-reek poets than Anacreon and the 
Pseudoanacreontics. The minor poets of the eighteenth century, 
however, re-introduced the note of epicurean libertinism and 
elegance which they found in the Anacreontea . Among the many 
poets who expressed anacreontic themes in conventional odes 

and facile rhymes were Voltaire, Chaulieu, Dorat, la Fare, 

3 ) 

Bernard, Bernis, Leonard and Colordeau.

The anacreontic influence penetrated the other arts as 
well, particularly in France• Watteau’s Venus Bathing and 
Boucher’s Venus and Cupid, to name only two examples, 
expressed the same ideas of grace and playfulness through the 
medium of paint and canvas. 

The influence of the Anacreontea spread to England, 

where it became very pronounced from about 1600 to 1650. Among 

the poets who imitated, translated or paraphrased the 

Pseudoanacreontics were Oldys, Sheffield, Cowley, Duke of 

Buckingham, Phillips, Cotton, Hughes, Hamilton, Cunningham, 

Thompson, Somervile, Prior, Garth, Parnell, Gray, Ramsay and 

Moore. The best known of the Cavalier poets, Carew, Suckling, 

Lovelace and Herrick, favored the anacreontic style above all 

others when writing occasional poetry. In elegant, 

conventionalized trifles these poets sang of the joys and sorrows 

of love in terms of classical metaphors. Cupid was the 

unfailing symbol of love, as the following stanza from Love 

Conquer’d by Lovelace indicates: 

The childish God of Love did swear 
Thus: "By my awful bow and quiver. 

Yon’ weeping, kissing, smiling pair, 

I’ll scatter all their vows i f th’ air, 

And their knit embraces shiver. 

The anacreontic tradition took root in Italy as well.

In the sixteenth century Guarini and Bembo sang of love in a 

playful manner. But the greatest anaoreontic poet was without 

doubt the seventeenth century Marino who sang of shepherds* 

lamentations, memories of past pleasures, invocations to the 

nightingale and love,-all in voluptuous verses borrowed from 

1 ) 

Greek, Latin, Italian, French and Spanish writers. A 

century later Zappi was to make use of these same anacreontic 

2 ) 

themes but on a far smaller scale. 

Spain was by no means invulnerable to anacreontic 

influence but here it tended to become blended with the 

picaresque tradition. The outstanding paraphraser and 

translator of the Anacreontea of the sixteenth century was 

Quevedo. He sang of wine and roses in a lively tone: 

Mezclemos con el vino diligentes 
la rosa delicada a los amores, 
y abrazando las frentes 
con las hermosas hojas y eolores^ 
de la rosa, juguemos descudadas. ' 

Also noted for his adaptations from Anacreon is the sixteenth 

century poet Villegas. 

Although the anacreontic influence reached Germany 
later than England, France, Italy or Spain, its force was by 
no means spent. It was the style of the day from about 1740

to 1770• Practically every writer tried his hand at it, with 
varying degrees of success. Among the best known German 
translators of the Anaereontea were Gleim, Uz, Gdtz, 
Seiferheld, MGrike and Langhans. As Goethe became familiar 
with anacreontic themes mainly through the German Anacreontics, 
we will devote the next chapter to a detailed account of 
their subject matter and style.

The eighteenth century in Germany ushered in a change 
of ideas. This was the period of Rococo. The attitude of 
insincerity which a century of Absolutism had bred did not 
disappear all at once, but carried over into the philosophy 
of life at the beginning of the century. People felt that 
it did not pay to be serious. The result was a superficial 
gaiety. Exaggerated manners, dainty lace at the cuffs and 
delicate perfume were all the fashion. In architecture the 
spotlight shifted from the movement, heaviness and violent 
color of Baroque to the lightness, daintiness and pastels of 
Rococo. In literature the crude eroticism of Hofmannswaldau 
and von Lohenstein gave way to a playful naughtiness. The 
idea of eat, drink and be merry was as popular as ever, but 
now the stress was laid on becoming delicately tipsy. The 
pastoral themes continued too, and as a result of French 
influence, became more refined than ever. They had their 
parallel in the increasing popularity of Dresden vases with 
their motifs of shepherd life. 

These trends of elegance, superficial gaiety and 
pastoral scenes culminated in the works of the German 
anacreontic poets. The representatives of this movement 
were Hagedorn, Gleim, Uz and G8tz and, to a lesser degree, 
Kleist, Ramler and Karschin. The three last mentioned are 
noted more for their friendship with the anacreontic poets

than for pronounced anacreontic traits in their own work. We 
will confine ourselves, then, to a brief account of the four 
major poets and to a discussion of their themes. 


The lives of the anacreontic poets formed a surprising 

paradox. Although they were respected townsmen and upstanding 

representatives of the middle class, in their free time they 

wrote some of the most insinuating if not actually risqu€ 

poetry to be found anywhere. This poetry soon tinged them 

with an evil reputation. According to Gleim, however, what 

the poet wrote and what he did were two different things. It 

was a mistake to surmise from the poet's works anything about 

his personal morality: 

Schlieszet niemals aus den Schriften der 
Dichter auf die Sitten derselben. Ihr werdet euch 
betrttgen; denn sie schreiben nur, ihren 
Witz zu zeigen, und sollten sie auch dadureh ihre 
Tugend in Verdacht setzen. Sie charakterisieren 
sich nicht, wie sie sind, sondern wie es die Art 
ihrer dedicate erfordert, und sie nehmen das Systems 
am liebsten an, welches am meisten Gelegenheit 
gibt, witzig zu sein. 1 ' 


Friedrich von Hagedorn (1708-1754) spent most of his 

life in his native Hamburg, with the exception of two years 

when he acted as private secretary to the Danish envoy in 

S) 

London. While at court he devoured the works of Pope,

Prior, Gay, Addison, Steele and Swift and was especially 
attracted to the writing of the Cavalier poets who stressed 
the enjoyment of life and praised wine and sensual love. 
Hagedorn introduced these ideas of love and wine into 
Germany but did not devote himself to them exclusively. In 
fact, he was more interested in didactic and epigrammatic 
poems, odes, and fables in the style of La Fontaine. Since 
he used anacreontic words and motifs to help point out a 
moral rather than to stimulate the reader's senses, as did 
Gleim for instance, Hagedorn must be considered as the fore¬ 
runner of the German Anacreontic movement proper. 

The three major German anacreontic poets, Johann 
Wi lhelm Ludwig Gleim (1719-1803), Jo fra fl A P et.SX J Jz (1720-1796) 
and Johann Nikolaus G8tz (1721-1781) came together as 
students at the University of Halle in 1739 and kept up a 
close friendship all their lives by means of interminable 
and often extremely sentimental letters. Gleim, who never 

married, became a canon in Halberstadt and for many years 

1 ) 

devoted his energies to helping young poets. By singing 
of wine and love until his death, he earned the affectionate 
title H der deutsche Anakreon”. Uz attained the rank of 
Privy Councillor in the principality of Ansbach and G8tz 
became a superintendent in the Palatinate. Together they

translated trie odes of Anacreon in 1746. After treating 
anacreontic themes for about a decade, Hagedorn, Uz and G8tz 
turned to other sources of inspiration. Gleim, however, 
praised the joys of wine and love as stoutly in his eighties 
as in his forties. 

Since we make no attempt to trace the influence that 
each of the major anacreontic poets has had on Goethe 
individually, we shall deal with their themes and motifs as 
a whole. 

The range of themes is fundamentally as limited as in 

Anacreon 1 2 s time. In an effort to achieve greater variety, 

Gleim and Gtfts treated old motifs a little differently and 

even introduced a few new ones, as for example the "wachsame 

Matter” motif, and shifted the focal point of the narration. 

The episode, whether a mild flirtation or a real affair, is 

related from the man's point of view* He is the aggressor 

2 ) 

and final conqueror. No matter how sparkling the lady's 
eyes nor haw sly her smile, the man would never admit that 
she had conquered him. A notable exception to this idea of 
male superiority is Gleim's Daphne an den Westwind . In this 
poem the shepherdess Daphne begs the wind to help her prepare

1) 

to sweep her shepherd Daphnis off his feet* 


Besides accentuating the man’s point of view, the 

poems of the Anacreontics sum up the early eighteenth century 

attitude to women. Women were expected to be decorative and 

pleasant to talk to, but no one expected them to see the 

inner surface of life’s meaning. What then was their purpose 

in life? G-leim replied that women were "lebend’ge Pup pen 

2 ) 

fttr die MSnner”. In fact, the only reason that the Creator 

made them is so that lonesome man would have something to 
3) 

play with. This ’doll motif’, which is clearly stated 
several times and implied upon other occasions, sets the tone 
for the whole idea of love. Life is ail play and love is 
the players’ favorite game. 


The lovers’ conversation is light, gay and teasing 

and their vows completely insincere. In Hagedom’s Liebe 

und Gegenliebe , Leander and his beloved pledge eternal 

faithfulness, at least until their respective spouses 
4) 

return. This is not true feeling but only playing with 
emotion. Granted, love colors all thoughts and sometimes 
leads to an embarrassing situation, as in Gleim’s Per 
Reohenschtller;

This dallying can be turned off and on at will* It has no 

connection with reason but is based on desire and does not 

2 ) 

look forward to a lasting union* Sensuous enjoyment is 

the end in itself. If one of the lovers should happen to 

think of marriage, he or she is quickly corrected, as in 

Gleim's Abschied von Qhloris : 

Sie fing mit hundert Tfttssen an, 

Und hundert folgten drauf. 

Sie sprach: Mein liebster kttnft'ger Manat

Love, time or otherwise, is not allowed to run its 
own course for long* Nymphs and fauns appear out of nowhere, 
supposedly to assist the lovers, but actually to display the 
poet's skill in describing the female form* The emphasis 
is on the sensual and the words are selected to quicken the 
emotions: 

••••da lauschen furchtsame Nymphen, 4) 

Nur halb durchs junge Gestr&uche bedecktl

mythology are also present to give the lovers their blessing, 

of which the chief ones are Amor, Bacchus, Pan, Zephyr, Zeus, 

Hymen, Cythere (Venus), Psyche and Cynthia (Diana). Of 

these, Amor plays the greatest part in bringing the lovers 

together. In Gleim's Per Vermittler for example, he supplies 

a young man with a love balm to ensure a favorable reply to 

1 ) 

his wooing. Descriptions of Amor vary from a curly-headed 

3 ) 

lad blowing kisses to a crafty rogue who kelps deceive a 
3) 

faithful husband. To maintain the antique atmosphere, the 
poet addresses his lady as Doris, Ilmira, Phyllis, Chloris, 
Chloe, Daphne or Filinde. He disguises the hero under such 
names as Korydon, Leander, Kleon, Philomon, Baucis and Dion. 
This predilection on the part of the Anacreontics for 
references from ancient times is not hard to understand if 
we consider the system of education of the eighteenth 
century. Having been so thoroughly steeped in the classics, 
they were more familiar with them than with the literature 
of the day. 

Another favorite motif connected with the theme of love 
is dancing and playing. The dance is generally a boisterous 
affair held in the open air. Even the old people are invited

to join in the merriment. Once the music rings out all 

restraint vanishes: 

....Und ohne Gttrtel tanzen g . 

Und bei den Tgnzen lachen. ' 

In Uz f Die Liebe the favorite accompanying instrument is the 

3) 

lyre, just as it was in the days of .Anacreon. Although 

the dance is open to everyone, it is seldom that a whole 

group takes part in a game. Only the lovers participate, 

and as a rule, they invent their own game. In one instance 

the young man throws rosebuds at his Doris, who rewards 

4) 

every hit with a kiss. On another occasion M ein Tierchen 

ohne Namen" helps the young man play with Filinde by hopping 

5 ) 

on her neck, inviting to be caught. 


A favorite motif closely associated with playing is 

that of dreaming. Sometimes it is nature which lulls the 

young man into voluptuous dreams as in Uz f Die Nacht : 

Murmelt ihr, wann alles ruht, 

Murmelt, sanftbewegte Bourne, 

Bei dem SprudeIn heischrer Flut 
Mich in wollustvolle Traume.^} 

At other times the thought of the beloved is conducive to 

visions of her. In one dream the young man sees his loved

one bathing. Awaking very inopportunely, be wants to fall 

1) 

asleep again to continue where the dream left off. Dreaming 
can even become an obsession, as is the experience of the 
young man in Gleim's Geschgfte who dreams of nothing but 

T5 

girls awake or asleep. 

Another motif which appears but which does not seem to 

have been exploited fully is the motif of the chase. Hagedorn 

presents it most picturesquely in the form of a comparison. 

The hunter trails the wounded roe deer through blood stained 

paths. Finally his victory shout rings out. Similarly a 

young man hunts his Phyllis along flower bedecked paths. 

Although it is not stated, he is presumably as successful 

3) 

as the game hunter. 

Parental opposition often makes the lovers 1 2 3 4 rendezvous 
impossible. When this happens the young people use all 
their tricks to outwit the parents, especially "die wachsame 
Mutter". The mother knows all the answers when it comes to 

4) 

love and has definite ideas how young people should behave. 

In Gleim's An den Tod the young man asks why death carried off 
his sweetheart when he would much rather have seen the last

of the mother, who resembles death so closely* Even in the 

young man's dreams, the mother, aiming to preserve her 

daughter's reputation, separates the lovers: 

Aoh mdchte doch, uns zu erfreun 
Die Mutter nicht im Wagen sein.^) 

The young lover has to have a good deal of experience in 

spiriting off the daughter* Sometimes the inexperienced 

lover misses a splendid opportunity through his own clumsiness. 

Kleon, for instance y that impeccable gentleman, is so stupid 

that he does not know how to revive Dorine , who has fainted 

in his arms. The poor fool calls on the girl's mother for 

assistance. Tongue in cheek, Hagedorn comments: 

3) 

Man muss ihn in die Schule schicken. 

The second major theme sung by both the Anacreontics 

and the Greek master himself is wine, but the eighteenth 

century approach differs considerably from the classical. 

In Per Wein for example, Hagedorn treats the origin of wine 

in a pseudo-biblical manner. It was Noah who discovered 

that the juice flowing frcm the grapes was life itself and 

passed this secret on to his children. Wine was the greatest 

consolation that could be granted the good people after 

4 ) 

the Flood. Gleim on the other hand personifies the

intoxicating power of wine in the foim of Bacchus, the wine 

god. In Trinklied he advocates that mortals follow the example 

of Bacchus so that virtue may he recognized on earth. 

Furthermore the wise man betakes himself to Bacchus as does 

1 ) 

the successful businessman. In Per Friedensstifter Gleim 

hints that wine and love can bring peace to war tom Europe 

2 ) 

since all other means have failed. Realizing that the 

popularity of wine does not morally justify its consumption, 

the Anacreontics defended their ease by citing the sentiments 

of the ancient Greek himself. Gleim writes: 

Anakreon, mein Lehrer, 

Singt nur von Wein und Liebe; 


Soli derm sein treuer Schttler 
Yon Hasz und Wasser singen ? 1 2 3 4 5 > 

Apparently one could quote no higher authority. To his 

imitators, Anacreon f s word was law. 


Wine is conducive to company. The tippler gathers 
around him a group of his friends who are brothers one with 

4) 

another for all time, or at least as long as the wine lasts. 

This motif of friendship among men is very popular. The 

5) 

friends even use such pet names as "Liebling". Gleim 
reaches the peak of sentimentality by expressing the desire

to kiss Uz: 

Kaiint’ ich mitten im Vergnttgen 
Dich, mein Uz, zu kttssen kriegen; 

K8nnt f ich denn bei solchen Freuden 
Meines Ftlrsten Gltlck beneiden?!) 

In fact, friendship among men was practically equated with 

love for women* The former was thought of as being more 

spiritual and hence on a somewhat higher plane. In Per 

2 ) 

Rechensentiler Gleim eulogizes love of both sisters and brothers. 

With a little romancing over a bottle of wine comes a 

problem which Gleim describes as follows: 

Soil ich trinken Oder kttssen? . 

Hier winkt Bacchus, dort Cythere. 1 2 3 4 ' 

The author is forced to choose between love and wine. On one 

hand the boughs are so heavy with grapes that they are bending 

toward him; on the other a seductive, raven-haired beauty 

bids him come. The choice is indeed difficult because he is 

determined to have both. Love wins out as he decides that the 

wine must wait for the moment. 

Another motif closely connected with the praise of wine 

and drinking, is adornment with flowers. At times myrtle is 

4 ) 

used to make a wreath for the head but roses are by far the 
favorite. Gleim presents the picture of Anacreon perfuming

his beard and decking himself with roses, singing of nothing 

, i) 

but wine and love all the while. As already mentioned, 

roses appear often as symbols of love-play. In this connection 

G-fltz pays them the highest tribute possible by calling them 

2) 


"holde TBchter der Cythere." Roses and lilies seem to be 

admired not for their own beauty but for the ideas of 

romance associated with them. In Die hie be for example, Uz 

identifies them with feminine beauty: 

Diese Rosen frischer Wangen 
Diese Lilien einer Brust. 1 2 3 4 ' 

In another passage we find the same thought expressed: 

4) 

Wo sttsser Lippen Rosen bltthn. 


All the scenes of love and conviviality over a bottle 

of wine are set against a background peculiar to anacreontic 

writing. The favorite meeting places are a shady nook in 

the grass beside a bubbling brook, a secluded valley dotted 

with concealing bushes and shrubs, a vantage point beside a 

cooling waterfall, or an arbor overhung with vines: 

Ich liebe Feld und Bach, der Sonne Morgenstrahl, 
Ein schwarz beschattet einsam Thai 
Und jenen stillen Lorbeerwald, . 

Wo keuscher Musen Fldte schallt. 5 '

fact all nature seems to have been created for the sole 

puipose of increasing the pleasures of love:

Alles dienet deinen Kindern.

The setting does not as a rule intrude into the poem but acts 

only as a backdrop to the scenes being enacted against it# 

Nature is so conventionalized that the reader can 
practically guess what description will follow# There is 
always first a suggestion of privacy, a place of intimacy 
such as a little oak forest or a laurel grove# Then a cover¬ 
ing is mentioned, either the starry sky or broad green leaves# 
No nature description would be complete without mention of 
shade in some form or other# To complete the pattern the 

poet generally refers to something living, as for example,

a nightingale# As a rule the writer at this point discreetly 

draws the curtain. In Die Brinnerung , however, Gleim cannot 

resist giving the reader a glimpse of scattered flowers and

broken grass after the rendezvous is over# 

The favorite time is obviously the late evening or 
early night. Hagedom welcomes night for its concealing

Midnight seems to be the magic hour for both nature and the 

2 ) 

work-a-day world are asleep. Only love is still awake. 

The best loved season is without doubt the spring. Gieim 

begs it to return, as Doris is most responsive to his kisses

when the nightingale is singing. The month of May is 
praised to the practical exclusion of all others. This is 
the glorious time when both nature and love reawaken. How 
the nightingale sings his most ravishing songs, luring back 
the balmy weather. The lark sings while circling; the 

4) 

storks clatter past and the fluttering starlings gossip. 

For Hagedorn the first of May was the happiest day of his 

life because on this day he confessed his love to his

sweetheart. Gieim rejoices that he is to be allowed to

address his beloved as ®du f on the tenth.

in their quaint garb. They are too busy failing in and 
out of love to bother about any sheep. Besides, common 
dirty sheep would not be elegant enough for them. They 

2 ) 

would be content with nothing less than perfumed lambs. 

As he became older and more sedate, Uz turned against this 

frivolity calling it "Schafertugend" and denouncing it as 

3) 

"abgeschmackt an muntrer Jugend zu unsrer Zeit." Perhaps 

the only part of this rustic life in which the German 

Anacreontics;ever actually believed was the superiority of 

nature to civilized city life. In nature they believed they 

would find the peace and happiness they sought. Like 

Rousseau, Gleim praised the simple uncultured existence: 

In meinem Httttchen geht mir f s gut; 

Wie kann mir's ttbel gehn? 


Ich kann die halbe Gotteswelt 
Aus meinem Httttchen sehn.^J 

Although they never reflected nature in a particularly 
versatile or original manner, they did at times turn to 
her for inspiration: 

Wer euch, ihr sttszen Musen liebt, , 

Der scherzt an eurer Hardin blumenvollen Beldern. 5 '

They were self satisfied to the point of being smug. Although 

they were not rich, they were honorable and like Anacreon, 

1 ) 

they could afford to scorn ”den reichen Pdbel." They were 

their own masters and life was good. They envied no one, not 

2 ) 

even their ruler his wealth. Since their incomes depended 

on stable business conditions, they were no lovers of war: 

Helden, dingt mich nicht zum Dichteri 
Meine Laute will nicht schallen, 

Wenn ich euch ein Loblied singe. 

The mood of anacreontic poetry as a whole is light, 

teasing and playful. No one would think of taking seriously 

the philosophy of life it presents. It claims that such 

philosophers as Wolff, such poets as Haller and such critics 

as Bodmer are hopelessly deluded. The Anacreontics, according 

to Gleim, being much better versed in worldly wisdom, have 

discovered the true purpose of life:

Und nttchtern und mit kaltem Blut , .

The mask of conviviality is sometimes partly lifted, 

even if only for an instant* G-leim, for instance, muses that 

he will die and be buried and his remains will turn 

2 ) 


to dust. Occasionally the writer conjures up a startlingly 
realistic death scene. Grleim addresses Death, who has just 
claimed his sweetheart, in these words: 

Frische rosenrote Wangen, 


Bltthen nicht fftr blasse Knochen, 

Bltthen nicht fttr deine Lippen, 

Tod, was willst du mit dem M&dchen? 

Mit den Z&hnen ohne Lippen , 

Kannst du es ja doch nicht kttssen. ' 

Here too Uz, who seems to delight in having the last word, 

gives us the epitomy of gruesomeness: 

Unser Leben selbst ist Rauch. 

Weht nicht ttber frische Leichen 
Jedes Morgen ktthler Hauch? 4 ' 


The vocabulary used by these poets merits attention* 

They deliberately chose words to excite the reader’s senses, 

primarily the sense of sight, smell and touch: 

Musz ich noch Rosen pflttcken, 

Weil ich den Duft noch rieche; 

Musz ich noch MSdchen kttssen. 5 )

They lavished great care on the description of the female 
fom, especially the female bosom. Some of their stock 
expressions are "halbentblflsster Busen", "offne Brust", 
"rabenschwarze Locken" and "sttsse Lippen rt . Their word 
choice shows that pleasure was their goal in life. In this 
connection the nouns most commonly repeated are "Wollust", 
"Scherz", "Freude", "Vergnttgen", "Liebe", "Verlangen", "Reiz", 
"Lust", "Wein" and "Kttsse". The verbs used are generally 
rich in images, as for instance "bltlhen", "gltthen", 
"schlummern", "springen", "httpfen", "lachen", "buhlen", 
"trinKen", "tr&umen", "tanzen" and "baden". The references 
to nature are general and conventional. The Anacreontics 
sing of "Thai”, "Bach", "Feld", "Busch", "Schatten", "Strom", 
"Fluss", "See", "Ufer", "Baum", "Laube" and "Trauben". These 
poets did not experience nature; in place of genuine feeling 
they presented a stereotyped, artificial landscape. 

The anacreontic poets were as coy as the maidens they 

depicted. They made a fine art of insinuation and could imply 

a senuous delight calculated to make the reader envious: 

Das letztere leichtflatternde Gewand 
Sank; welch ein BlickJ Die artige Belinde 
?fard urn und urn ein Spiel der sanften Tinde, 

Wo sie, wie Venus einst auf Ida, stand. ) 

They could also imply mixed shame and pride as does Gleim in

An die Sonne . In this poem the young lover praises the sun 

for its life-giving warmth but wishes it would not shine so 

brightly into the grove, since "mich in der Sommerlaube keine 

1 ) 

Mutter sehen sollte#. Gleim and Uz were fond of skirting 

the borderland between decency and indecency. The climax 

of many of their poems consists of a play on -words or an 

expression that could also be interpreted innocently, as for 

instance the following: 

Ihm (Amor) dient e in weiches Kanapee 

So gut und besser noch als im geheimen Haine 

Beblttmtes Gras und sanfter Klee. 1 2 ' 

By putting forward suggestions and then coyly retractirg them, 

the German Anacreontics injected an element of illusion into 

their writing. Only rarely are their poems built around a 

strong plot. They depend for their effect on a number of 

ideas which are repeated again and again, as in the popular 

jingle. All in all, it is only their superficial gloss which 

makes them palatable. 

In summary, the German Anacreontics, Hagedorn, Gleim, 
Uz, and G8tz set up an imaginaiy world of sensuous pleasures 
in which they praised love and wine in terms of emotion they 
did not feel. Their poems range from charming little verses 
to risque innuendoes. They were fond of a pastoral setting

or at least a rendezvous in the open air. But they exhibit 
no real deep-seated love for nature. Their themes are as 
limited as their stock of favorite words which appear in 
every second line. On the other hand, the endless treatment 
of the same motifs made the poets inventive and conscious 
of detail. The result was the skilfully turned phrase, 
the versatile form and the delicate grace which their lyric 
productions embody.

CHAPTER V 


GOETHE’S ■ANNETTE LIEDER* 


Viel singt er von Glut und Liebe, 
Sie wird feurig, er wird kEthn. 

Sie empfindet neue Triebe, 

Und Gelegenheit maeht Diebe. 
Endlich - Gute Nacht, Amin. 

•- Lyde , by Goethe 





49 


On the nineteenth of October 1765, sixteen year old 
Johann Wolfgang Goethe registered as a student at the University 
of Leipzig. Far from his family and friends in Frankfurt, he 
was often lonely. He had few friends among the students for 
his precocious bearing did not appeal to his acquaintances 
in Leipzig. It is no wonder that he longed for the admiration 
and love which could ccrne only from a woman’s heart. His 
fondest dreams came true in Easter 1766, when he fell in 
love with a "M&dchen ohne Stand und YermOgen", the daughter 
of the inn-keeper and wine seller SchOnkopf, at whose house 
Goethe dined. Goethe became intimate with the family and the 
other guests, but especially with the only daughter of the 
house, the nineteen year old Anna Katharina (Annette) 

Schdnkopf. She, too, was attracted to the merry, clever 
student even though he was three years her junior. To do 
her honor he entitled his first slim volume of poetry Annette . 

Although Goethe concealed this friendship from his 
sister for a year, he confided all his experiences to his 
friend Ernst Wolfgang Behrisch, whom he had met at the 
same time as K&thchen. Goethe kept Behrisch, who was eleven 
years his elder, informed of the joys and tribulations of his 
youthful love. Only too often Goethe imagined that other 
suitors were competing with him, for KSthchen, as the 
innkeeper’s daughter, was observed and admired by many.

Thus he vacillated between love and jealousy. During his 

three years in Leipzig he could not decide whether to propose 

marriage to K&thchen and make her his, or not. KSthchen, 

however, was too clever to put all her trust in a student 

three years younger than herself, who, moreover, soon had to 

return to a distant city. After experiencing love's joy and 

pain for two years, they talked the matter over and then 

parted as friends. The next year (1769) Kfithehen became 

1 ) 

engaged to Dr. Kanne, a young lawyer. 

It is against this background that the 'Annette Lieder' 
were written. After reading them we realize that no author, 
no matter how great, can divorce himself completely from his 
environment and let his genius unfold independent of time 
and place. As a young student in Leipzig, Goethe had not 
found a style of his own, although his talent seemed to lie 
primarily in the field of the lyric. It was therefore only 
natural that he turned his attention to the most popular 
contemporary German lyricists, the Anacreontics. Now that 
we are familiar with the content and style of anacreontic 
poetry and have traced its development from Anacreon to 
Hagedorn, Gleim, Uz and GOtz, we can try to assess the 
influence which the anacreontic tradition has had upon 
Goethe. By so doing, we shall also be in a position to 
determine whether the 'Annette Lieder' reveal evidences of 
non-conventional thought as well,

An Annetten 

An Annetten , the opening poem in the collection 

, Annette Lieder’, is not a song in praise of the young lady’s 

beauty or charm as the wording might suggest, but a dedication. 

It was the custom in the eighteenth century, just as it is 

today among many authors, to dedicate a literary work to a 

patron or a friend. In this case the first poem generally 

stood apart from the succeeding ones and varied from a short, 

skilfully phrased ’thank you* to an example of out and out 

hero worship. G-leim, for instance, wrote the ’Scherzhafte 

1 ) 

Lieder’ for his dear friend Uz and dedicated them to him. 

But young Goethe, filled with newly awakened emotions and 
trying his wings for the first time, as it were, is not at 
all content to dedicate his collection of poems to a friend. 
Having once felt the pangs of love, he is ready to repudiate 
friendship as a poor substitute for a lady’s smile. He must 
set these feelings down on paper, albeit in a somewhat 
exaggerated form. 

After ruling out a friend or friends as a possible 
subject for the dedication, he has two choices left. As he 
says:

Es nannten ihre Bticher 

Die Alten sonst nach Gdttern, , 

Nach Musen und nach Freunden. 1 ) 

He could in true classical style, dedicate his f Annette Lieder* 

to the gods enthroned on Mount Olympus, perhaps Jove, Venus, 

Bacchus or Cupid. Or he aould^ing the praises of the Muses, 

the nine goddesses of ancient Greece who presided over poetry, 

art and science. But even at eighteen Goethe intends to be 

original. Since no one dedicates poems to one's beloved, he 

will establish a new trend. Besides being original, Goethe 

is truthfully giving credit where it is due, for Annette 

and not the works of the ancients, is his immediate inspiration. 

The reference to "Gutter", "Musen” and "Freunde" remind us of 

Anacreon and the German anacreontic poets. But it would 

seem that Goethe has departed a little from true anacreontic 

tradition since he praises love to the practical exclusion 

of wine. Goethe is not a wine poet. In fact, in only one 

poem of this collection does he make any mention of wine. His 

exultation of "die Liebste" outlines the basic character of 

the poems to follow. He can find more than enough inspiration 

in love alone without resorting to praising the joys of wine. 


1) Goethe: Werke, III; 182, 1-3. All quotations of Goethe's 
poetry are taken from the "Jubil&umsausgabe". We 
follow the order of the poems in this edition. The

the page and the last to the line(s).

The final lines reveal the impetuous young lover, ardent and 

all-inclusive in his love: 

.Annette, 

Die Du mir G-ottheit, Muse, . v 
Und Freund mir bist, und alles. ' 

In Annette he finds an idol (Gottheit), an inspiration (Muse) 

and a companion (Freund). 

Although we cannot say that the whole idea of a 
dedication is anacreontic since many nonanacreontic poets 
writing at the same time also used this device, we can trace 
several distinctly anacreontic traits in the poem. Goethe*s 
references to "die Alten," w G8tter," "Musen” and "Freunde” 
are conventional and appear again and again in the works of 
Gleim, Uz and G8tz. The poem has the grace and charm we 
generally associate with poetry of this type. Addressing 
the girl directly by her first name reminds us again of Gleim 
or Uz. Anacreontic too is the use of the old spelling of 
"Nahmen" for modern "Namen" and "diesz" Buch for "dies" Buch. 
The Anacreontics believed older spellings and archaic words 
added a touch of antiquity to their works in keeping with 
references to gods and shepherds.

Ziblis, eine Zrzahlung 


The next poem, Ziblis , is modelled on the age old 
pattern of the story teller reciting a tale to a group of 
people sitting at his feet. But Goethe, finding this image 
incomplete, sets himself up as a moralist as well, and calling 
the girls to him, prepares to deliver a moral lecture in verse. 

He discounts the warning of cautious mothers: "MSdgen, flieht 

1 ) 

der Manner List.” The thought behind the advice, he 
implies, is well meant and very true, but the method of 
presentation is decidedly old-fashioned if not actually 
faulty. The warning is not very effective anyway, because 
the girls let themselves be fooled in spite of it. The body 
of the poem is, so to speak, Goethe’s revised version of the 
story of the birds and the bees. 

We are introduced to Ziblis, a young, sweet, innocent 

girl who seems to have been created only for love. But 

strangely enough, she shuns love and devotes herself completely 

to her hobby of hunting: 

Ziblis jung und schdn, zur Liebe, 

Zujder ZSrtliehkeit gemacht, 

Floh aus rauhem wildem Triebe, 

Nicht aus Tugend alle Liebe, 

Ihre Freude war die Jagd. 1 2 '

From these lines we see that the mother*s admonitions have had 
just the opposite effect from that which they were intended 
to have. Whatever natural virtue Ziblis may have possessed 
has long since vanished. She has been frightened into being 
good. This goodness which parades under the name of virtue 
is really prudishness, declares Goethe. It is essential that 
the reader be aware of this distinction if he is to view the 
hero's conquest in the proper light. 

Suddenly a horned monster springs out of an oak tree 

and approaches Ziblis. The nymph's first reaction is one of 

fear. She is paralysed with fright and becomes as white as 

a corpse. The monster laughs tenderly, probably enticingly, 

but Ziblis, appalled by his sudden appearance, turns her head 

aside. Seeing that she will not accept his overtures, he 

1 ) 

springs after her ”wie ein htipfend Feuer.” The pursuit 

becomes wilder and wilder. Before them looms a clump of 

lindens growing beside a stream. But Ziblis has eyes only 

for Emiren who is resting in the grass by the water's edge. 

Emiren responds to her cry. He rejoices at her helpless 

condition and apparently thinks of his future reward because 

Goethe describes his feeliigs thus: 

........Er voll Freude, 

Dass er so die Nymphe sah. 1 2 '

The protagonists are ready; the battle begins* From 

the very outset Ziblis trembles for the youth's safety* The 

rivals roll over and over on the ground until finally 

Emiien rises victorious. But the shock has been too much 

for Ziblis. Like any delicately minded, well-brought up 

girl she faints at the first suggestion of physical violence* 

As she is lying semi-conscious in the grass Imiren is not 

slow to seize his opportunity. He claims his reward and 

1 ) 

rt es folgten Kttsse hundertweis." The prudent mother's 
advice has been to no avail for in her first encounter with 
love, every other thought goes out of Ziblis' head. Love 

2 ) 

grows into passion. Soon both are "trunken von Yergnttgen". 

We can imagine the gleam in young Goethe's eyes as he sums 

up the episode with this cynical comment: 

Endlich trunken von Yergnttgen, 

Ward dem Emiren das Siegen, . 

Wie ihr denken kdnnt, nicht schwer. ' 

Stepping back into his former role of moralist, Goethe 
draws two conclusions from the tale. Wild, lustful men such 
as the Waldgott are not so dangerous for young girls as the 
gallant ones like Emiren who speak only of innocent amusement. 
These men, who are outwardly respectable, will not stop with

57 

winning a girl*s heart. Thus, love making is a serious 

business. To do it properly one must have one's wits about 

one all the time. Goethe advises: 

Seyd viel lieber klug als kalt. 

Zittert stets fttr eure Herzen. 1 ) 

We could paraphrase these liras as follows;- Let your head 

rule your heart in matters of love, because if you lose your 

heart, you might as well say goodbye to your virtue. 

After reading this poem, the reader asks himself: 

Does Goethe really mean this or is he having fun with us? 

His conception of himself is a little hard to believe. He 

sets himself up as a man of the world and at the same time as 

a champion of virtue. This young Don Juan, in true anacreontic 

fashion, considers himself an adept at feminine psychology. 

He maintains that a girl is infatuated by physical beauty: 

Immer wird das Herz der Schdnen 
Auf des Schdnen Seite seyn. 2 ^ 

A girl does not do anything without first having calculated 

its effect. But these feminine wiles cannot fool Goethe: 

Leicht sind Madgen zu erquikken, 

Oft ist ihre Krankheit Spas. 3 4 ) 

He even expresses his worldly wisdom epigrammatically: 

4 ) 

Schreyn kann niemals ttberwinden.

It is hard to believe that Goethe can turn about and in 

practically the same breath warn girls away from such 

respectable men as himself. Probably the whole poem is a 

skilfully contrived bluff. If this is true, the reader must 

take his clue from the first two lines: 

M&dgen, sezzt euch zu mir nieder, 

Niemand stdhrt hier unsre Ruh. 1 2 ' 

Further proof that Goethe is more interested in present¬ 
ing a sensuous situation than a moral lesson is the fact that 
he devotes three full stanzas to Emiren's wooing, which amounts 
to one quarter of the tale proper. In this love scene Goethe 
uses many expressions calculated to stimulate the senses. 

Probably the most effective of these is the line; w Ja die 

2 ) 

MMulgen schmekken sttsse. M If the interpretation that 
Goethe is aiming at a sensuous delight rather than a moral 
lesson is correct, the poem deserves to be called purely 
anacreontic 'Tandelei*. 

Goethe makes use of all the anacreontic motifs he can 
squeeze into the piece. The setting is as conventional as it 
can be. It is spring, the favorite season because both love 
and flowers begin to bloom. It is also the time when the air 
is filled with the songs of birds and lovers. When we first

meet Ziblis she is "tief im Gestrauche". This is so 
typically anacreontic that we surmise correctly that all the 
action occurs here* No scene, however, would be complete 
without a rushing brook* With the exception of an oak and 
a linden, these are the only references to nature. They 
give us a sketchy picture of nature as a background but they 
are too cold and factual to be interesting in themselves. 

In this poem we have a variation of the "wachsame 
Mutter” motif. The mother is generally regarded as the 
obstacle to true love. Here, however, she is the "weise, 
strenge Mutter” who warns against young men’s coaxing ways. 

Just as typically anacreontic is the motif of the chase. 

2 ) 

Uz presents a similar account in his Magister Duns . 

Love, Goethe feels, is a strong, overpowering force. Away 
from the protection of the watchful mother every girl weakens 
under its spell. In contrast it strengthens the young man, 
enabling Emiren to overcome a god. Let us look at the conflict 
more closely. It is a splendid parody of the medieval 
tournament, in which two knights jousted for a lady’s favor. 

But instead of a lance or a mace, the hero of the burlesque 
wields a branch torn from the nearest willow. After an

exchange of sneers the duel begins in earnest* Soon all 
appearance of dignity is thrown to the winds and the combatants 
wrestle in the sand* The outcome of the battle is not long 
in doubt for Emiren has something to fight for. The idea of 
the young man, who offers to assist a lady and who has already 
a reward in mind is utilized by both Gleim and Uz. The 
ending, where Emiren tosses the faun into the pond, is hardly 
chivalrous but certainly entertaining. 

The tone is jaunty and brash. The style is down to 
earth but the scenes lack real warmth and depth, Among the 
many anacreontic cliches used are tf Blumen n , "Liebe", "Triebe", 
"Gestrduche", "Freude w , "Rymphe", "erbeben", "Herz", "Schdne", 
n Kuss n , "begierig", "Vergnttgen", "Siegen", "buhlerisch", 
"Wollust", n scherzen H , and "zittern". Goethe makes effective 
use of a literary device to achieve verisimilitude. After 

reporting the rather incredible love scene he says solemnly: 

1 ) 

"Glaubt es mir" and we are almost inclined to do just this. 
The method of telling someone else r s story by way of giving 
advice may be regarded as a new twist to an old motif. Purely 
anacreontic is the borrowing of names from mythology and 
reference to the horned God of the forest.

to think he could ever have written anything purely imitative. 

Ziblis , however, is about as strongly influenced by outside 

sources as a work could be. Nevertheless we can see a few of 

Goethe’s traits peeping out - his youthful conceit, his vanity 

and, if we read some of his letters to his friend Behrisch, 

1 ) 

his jealousy. It is hardly necessary to add that Ziblis is 
a thinly veiled pseudonym for ICfithchen Schdnkopf. 


Lyde, eine Erzffhlung 

In this poem Goethe again makes use of the device of 
the story teller. He has been so encouraged by the response 
and applause which his first vignette has brought forth, 
that he will sing a new song. The author does his utmost to 
convince us that he is omniscient and at the same time, 
completely disinterested. His only desire in telling this 
tale is to set wrong right. He advises: Do not be deluded 
in affairs of the heart for 

.wenn zwey sich zgrtlich ktlssen. 


1) Fleissner and Mentz-Fieissuer, Per junge Goethe , p.106. 









62 


G-ern sich sehn, und ungern missen, 

Es nicht stets aus Liebe sey. ' 

With these words Goethe sets out to distinguish between love 

and sensuality. 

In true anacreontic phraseology the lovers "brannten" 
for one another. But apparently ft ein wiedriges Geschikke 
hinderte noch beider Glttkke”. After this grandiose preparation 
we expect that something world shaking, such as a decree of 
the gods, is preventing their union. Goethe, however, brings 

us back to harsh reality by means of a delightful anticlimax - 

3 ) 

"Ihre illtern schliefen nie". Lyde's only thought is to 

outwit her parents for a sweet hour in Amin f s arms. Together 

they drink their fill of the forbidden pleasures of sensual 

love. But Amin tires of so much "Beute". He is a little 

dismayed to discover that even sensuality may become stale 

after a while for: 

...Jede Freude 

Indigt sich mit aem Genusz. ' 

As his passion cools he becomes more rational, then skeptical 
and finally suspicious. He wonders: Does she love me for 
myself or because I am the first man she has ever met? 

Resorting to cunning, he decides to test her love.

He claims that his father needs him to tend the sheep 
in a distant field. He must go, hut, just to make sure that 
Lyde is in good hands, he will leave her his best friend 
who will amuse her with pleasant songs during his absence. 
Amin leaves with a heavy heart and his faithless friend steps 
into his place. The sad tale is soon told and it is "Gute 

i) 

Naeht, Amin". But the lady is at least partly exonerated 

2 ) 

because "Gelegenheit macht Diebe". After all what did 
Amin expect? His friend used the same technique that he did. 
If it snared Lyde once, why not twice? 

To finish off the tale Goethe steps in again with the 
moral which holds good today as well as in the eighteenth 
century: 

Kinder, seht, da mtlsst ihr wachen, 

Such vom Irrthum zu befreyn. 

Glaubet nie den Schein der Sachen, 

Sucht euch ja gewisz zu machen, 

Bh f ihr glaubt geliebt zu seyn. s ) 

Love at first sight is a fallacy, Goethe explains, albeit a 

pleasant rationalization. Look behind the surface of things, 

for appearances are notoriously deceptive. Finally in 

matters of the heart look before you leap. This is excellent 

advice, but what young person in love is going to stop and 

mull it over?

Once more the theme is love. But it is not love in the 

frivolous manner of the Anacreontics. Here it is at least 

somewhat more true to life and certainly more serious. After 

the first infatuation doubts appall the lover. Perhaps the 

victory was just a little too easy. Goethe realizes that 

the peak of sensual enjoyment also marks its end: 

.Jede Freude v 

Endigt sich mit dem Genusz. 1 ' 

This is something new - a touch of sadness. It is a discordant 

note in a theme which is conventionally gay and teasing. Amin 

muses if passion always denotes real love: 

1st wohi bey des Blutes Wallen, 

Denkt er, immer Liebe da? 2 ' 

This question reveals the serious Goethe. It is really an 
attempt to analyze the ingredients of love, such as 
considerateness and amiability, as opposed to sensuality. 

The only solution to the problem, as Amin discovers, seems 
to be moderation. 

It is evident that in this poem Goethe utilizes 
anacreontic trappings to express his own ideas. Let us look 
at a few of these trimmings. He speaks, for instance, of 
"Schaferstunde" and "Heerde”. This is the only poem in which 
he introduces a pastoral theme. We also have another variation

of the "wachsame Mutter” motif. Now, however, both parents 

(iiltern) are thought of as guardians of the girl's virtue. 

They are told tney will need a hundred eyes to cope with the 

tricks of a girl in love. And if she can fool her parents, 

she can certainly fool her lover. The idea of a ruse is typically 

anacreontic. Amin does not dare question Lyde directly. The 

whole situation is so insincere that he knows he could not 

believe her words anyway. Another anacreontic feature is 

the motif of modesty. Amin mentions his friend with the result: 

1 ) 

Hier sah sie zur Erde nieder. 

We strongly doubt that this is genuine modesty. G-leim for 

instance, had a prudish maiden avert her eyes at the sight of 

2 ) 

unclothed Amor. Just as conventional is Goethe's reference 
to the lyre* 

Und verzeyht, wenn meine Leyer 
Nieht von jenem heil'gen Feuer 
Der geweyhten Dichter glttht.3) 

Goethe draws much of his vocabulary in the poem f rcm 
the anacreontic stock-in-trade. A few of these words are 
"Leyer”, "gltthen", "kttssen", "Lie be”, "brennen", "schlafen”, 
"SchMferstunde", "genieszen”, "sttsse Kttsse", "Freude", "Glut”, 
”feurig”, and "Triebe”. He again turns to older orthography:

"Gltixke”, ’’Ttlkke Tl , "zurtlkke”, "Geschikke", "verzeyht”, 

"geweyht”, ”sey”, ’’Madge n”, "frey”, "Beyfall", "dabey" and 

"zwey". The rendezvous scene is especially rich in visual 

imagery and stimulating words: 

Endlich kommt die Schaferstunde, 

Und von ihrem heissen Munde., 

Saugt imin die Wo1lust ein. ' 

The motif of the inconstancy of women is however ’echt 

goethisch’. Completely unanacreontic too is the treatment of 

the motif of friendship. Gleim and Uz, for instance, portray 

a friend as a bosom companion-, a faithful comrade. But in 

this poem .Amin’s friend is no friend at all. He plays such 

a mean trick on Imin that the latter would have been better 

advised to trust a complete stranger. 

Comparing the introduction of this poem with that of 
Ziblis, the reader might think that the two introductions had 
been written within a few minutes of each other. But as he 
reads farther he realizes that Ziblis is as anacreontic as 
it can be, whereas hyde expresses Goethe’s own ideas in 
conventional trappings. The tone of Lyde places it years 
later than Ziblis in terms of the poet’s outlook on life and 
points clearly to the developing poet.

Kunst, die Sprflden zu fangen. Erste Srzghlung . 


It would seem that Goethe firmly believes in the axiom 

'experience teaches' for he again offers advice in the form of 

a supposedly true story. Since the last two poems have 

presented the girl's point of view, he here restores the 

balance by addressing young men whose girls are prudish. His 

theme is 'love will melt any heart'. The story begins. A 

youth loves a young girl ardently but the girl, heeding her 

mother's admonitions, will have nothing to do with the male 

sex. Far from giving up hope, the young man starts to find 

the situation interesting. He treats his pursuit of the girl 

like a game in which the fun is just beginning or like a puzzle 

which can be solved only through patience. He concludes that 

the girl knows what love is in theory only. Placing his 

faith in this observation, he plans his strategy; 

Die Liebe sollst du bald empfinden, 

Und sollst nicht wissen, dass sie's ist. ' 

His immediate intention is to gain her confidence. He 
achieves this aim by means of frequent meetings and disinterested 
conversations. He mentions particularly certain exalted 
feelings, which he disguises under the name of friendship.

Since it is soon obvious that his presence colors the girl’s 

thoughts, he begins cautiously to undermine her mother’s 

admonitions. Before long he succeeds in replacing the 

mother as teacher, with the result that the girl begins to 

question the truth of her mother’s advice. By playing on 

these doubts, the young man convinces her: 

Dass auch die Freunde kttssen, 

Die Freunde so wie ich und du - - , 

Ich wagt’es - und sie liesz es zu.' 

Step two of his plan has succeeded far beyond expectations. 

The girl not only becomes accustomed to his kisses but feels 

slighted if she does not receive any. Becoming bolder, he 

woos her more passionately, believing his reward to be in 

sight. But the girl, suddenly realizing the danger, jumps 

up and runs off. The young man follows* He is too shrewd 

to stop now: 

Denn eher wird sie bey dem Fliehen, 

Als ich bey dem Verfolgen mttd.^' 

If he does not have his way now, he will another day. 

In this poem Goethe drops back into a lighter vein 
compared to Lyde . Both the first and second parts contain 
many anacreontic features. The setting, with its references 
"im Hayne" and "unter dem Schatten", is conventional. The

motif of the "wadi same Mutter* appears again. It is worth 
noting that Goethe is rarely content to present the mother 
merely as the disturber of anacreontic bliss as do Gleim and 
Uz. He goes farther back than that by trying to trace the 
influence the mother's teachings have had on the girl's 
personality. In this tale the mother's teaching has been 
negative and has turned her daughter's heart into ice. 

Obviously she failed to make clear the symptoms of love and 
the feelings which accompany it. Her words have instead 
turned men into monsters and love into evil. By shielding 
the girl from contact with the world, the mother succeeds only 
in making her more gullible. As it happens, virtue wins out, 
but only because of the girl's strength of character. 

Typically anacreontic is the presentation of the man 
as a sly rogue and the girl as an innocent but willing pupil. 

The whole approach to love on the part of the man is insincere. 

1 ) 

At the moment he loves the girl "recht feurig, recht z&rtlich" 
but he has no thought of lasting affection. He wants the 
immediate pleasures of love without the responsibilities which 
they entail. As in Lyde , the young man stoops to a ruse to 
influence the girl's heart. The motif of the chase is 
conventional as we have seen, but trie philosophizing regarding

the outcome is Goethe f s own contribution. 


Goethe ably demonstrates his understanding of how it 

feels to be in love - both from the young man's and the 

young woman*s point of view. He says, for example: 

Nie schmekt ein MSdgen einen Kusz, 

Die sich nicht nach dem zweeten sehnte. j -) 

Many of his observations of human nature may be interpreted 

with regard to his relations ’with H&thchen Schflnkopf. Here 

Goethe, the young lover is speaking: 

2 ) 

Wer stolz ist, ist Mhn. 

When all is said and done however, Goethe has still more to 

learn about himself as this egotistical passage reveals: 

Dem Liebiiaber glaubt ein Mfid-gen immer mehr, 
als der Mutter. 3 ) 

We are reminded of the ending of Ziblis by the lines: 

Hat sie uns nur erst eins erlaubt 
Das andre wird sie schon erlauben. ^ 

With the exception of these personal touches, the style can 

best be termed anacreontic. The story is told partly in 

verse, and partly in prose, after the model of uerstenberg*s 
5) 

Tgndeleien . This mixed form is clearly a forerunner of

the Urfaust . By claiming to tell a friend’s experiences as 
well as narrating in the first person, Goethe introduces the 
note of authenticity as in Ziblis . He again strives for 
archaic form by using such spellings as "zweete", "zwote", 
’’M&dgen”, "seyn”, n Hayn”, "trokken", ’’ward", "gieng" and 
"bey". This poem reveals Goethe’s growing skill in creating 
atmosphere and maintaining suspense. Both this ’ErzShlung’ 
and Lyde read like ’two-minute’ dramas. 


■ inst, die SprSden zu fangen* Zwote Erz&hlung * 


This tale bears little relation to the first except 

that they both illustrate methods of tricking the opposite 

sex. By making the one introduction apply to both parts, 

Goethe breaks right into his theme in the first two lines* 

Es ist kein Mfidgen so listig, so vorsichtig, 
das nicht von einem listigen Jtlngling kOnnte 
gefangen werden.l)

is a battle of wits in which the forces are more evenly 
divided. Both the girl and the young man are as sly as foxes. 
Charlotte, for this is the girl's name, loves the young man 
dearly but loves herself more. Thus she is very reserved in 
manner toward him when they are in the family circle. It 
is however a different story when they are alone in the 
grove, as the reader soon discovers. 

As they are enjoying a picnic under a shady tree one 
day, Amor suddenly flies out of a rose. The young man, who 
alone sees the god, rejoices at his luck, for he is sure 
that Amor T s arrows will find the way to his beloved's heart. 
One arrow is all that is necessary to destroy her coyness. 

But Amor is more interested in the heavy vines of grapes 
which twine their way over the arbor . Piercing the grapes 
one at a time with the point of an arrow, he sucks out the 
juice just as a bee draws nectar out of a flower. Having 
drunk his fill, he alights capriciously on the rim of the 
wine glass, where he begins to xo ck back and forth. Suddenly 
he takes a false step, loses his balance, teeters precariously 
on the edge and then with a loud cry tumbles into the wine. 

He is a picture of misery as he struggles, swims, sinks, 
splashes with his wings and steers with his hands and feet 
in the golden sea, bewailing his fate in a shrill voice all 
the while. The young man pities the little god, even though

lie has frustrated his plans, and helps him out* 

Thanking him sweetly, Amor hops into the sunshine, 
shakes the drops of wine from his wings and dries himself* 

As the hero watches his antics, it suddenly occurs to him 
that Amor f s quiver is empty. There is only one place the 
arrows can be. Looking into the glass of wine, he sees 
bubbles rising as the wine dissolves the sugar tips of the 
arrows. He realizes with joy that the wine is absorbing not 
only the sugar but also the magic love potion into which the 
arrows had been dipped. Tempermental Amor has helped him 
in spite of himself. The young man hands the cup to Charlotte, 
who drinks deeply. The love balm inflames her emotions and 

1) 

soon the young man, like little Amor, cries out "Sieg, 8ieg?. 

This typically anacreontic plot reminds us strongly of 

Grleim's Per Yerraittler , in which Amor also assists the young 

2 ) 

man to win the battle of love, and Hz* Amor und sein Bruder 

in which the little god helps bring Elmire and her lover 
3) 

together. Here, as in the poems of the Anacreontics, Goethe's 

words hold true: 

1st je ein Paar allein 
1st Amor niemals we it.

Just as conventional is the description of the setting. We 

glimpse a vine covered arbor set in a grove. Beside it grows 

a myrtle, the shrub whose leaves and white scented flowers 

were sacred to Venus. To complete the picture we see a flash 

of wine, a unique feature in the ’Annette Lieder’. This 

idyllic peace has long been the goal of hedonistic philosophers 

and calls to mind Omar Khayyam’s: 

.....a loaf of Bread beneath the Bough, a flask 
of Wine, a book of Verse and Thou. 1 2 3 4 ' 

Again as in the preceding tale, the young people converse 

politely about friendship. This artificiality does not fool 

anyone however. It would seem that Goethe has borrowed his 

image of Amor springing out of a rose from Gleim’s Per 
2} 3) 

Vermittler or Uz’ Per verlorene Amor . The second half of 

the reference, which compares the partly developed rose to 

a fifteen year old girl^ is also conventional. 

This tale is one of the best examples of the motif of 

love as a game. The young man tells Amor that he need not 

be too particular in his aim, for he (the young man) has 

already undemined the girl’s defences; 

Pu brauchst nicht scharf zu zielen, 

Pie Brust ist ohnbewehrt. '

Love is not to be taken too seriously. It is like a game in 

which one must learn a number of steps, each one a little 

more difficult than the one before: 

Ich hab' ihr, wie im Spielen, 

Gar manches schon gelehrt, 

Was ohne sich zu ftihlen,^ 

Kein junges M&dgen h8rt. * 

Deception in large or small matters is part of the game. Our 
hero for instance, has no qualms about crediting a bee with 
causing the splashing in the wine glass. 

Goethe has, however, taken a few liberties with the 

anacreontic tradition. It was conventional to humanize the 

gods, i.e. to depict them as possessing human foibles as well 

as strengths. Even though no one took them very seriously, 

it was only rarely that they were ridiculed. To be sure the 

Pseudoanacreontics represented Amor as capriciously shooting 

darts at his benefactor: 

Then laugh f d amain the wanton boy, 

And, "Friend,” he cry'd, "I wish thee joy; 
Undamag'd is my bow, I see H . 

But what a wretch I've made of theel^' 

But Goethe goes so far as to strip Amor of his last shred of 

divinity. He is a comical figure indeed as he is tossed to 

and fro in the wine. One has to laugh at him because in the 

cup of wine he looks as insignificant as - a drenched bee.

Goethe has reduced the god Amor to a saturated version of 
Tom Thumb* 

Several references in this tale remind the reader of 
older works. The comparison between the manner in which 
Amor pierces the grapes with his arrows and the bees pierce 

a flower to draw out honey suggests a passage in Gleim's 

i) 

Der Sammler. Under the effect of the love potion the 
“ 2 ) 
girl "lgchelte und schlug die Augen nieder." This recalls 

the girl's false modesty in Lyde * Here it is probably a 

trick of coquetry. 

Again, stylistically speaking, we have a personal 

touch in the use of the first person. Goethe makes it clear 

that he hopes Annette will learn a lesson from the tale and 

be less reserved in future. For the second time in the 

collection he addresses her directly by name. His male 

egotism crops up again as he says smugly of the girl: 

Ware sie ganz klug gewesen, so hStte sie mich 
ganz gemieden: doch sie war zu dieser That zu 
sehr M&dgen. 1 2 3 ' 

Among the favorite anacreontic expressions used by Goethe 
for the first time are: "Jtlngiing", "Myrthe", "Rose",

The two tales making up Triumph der Tugend act as 
companion pieces to the two tales of Kunst, die Sprdden zu 
fangen * Although the subject of both poems is passionate 
love, the outcome is entirely different. In Kunst, die 
SprSden zu fangen , sensuality wins out, whereas in Triumph 
der Tugend guiltless love reigns victorious. 

The shepherd Daphnis steals off with his sweetheart 

to the temple of the Dryads in order to be alone with her:

gives the reader an insight into the anacreontic representation 

of nature. Goethe refers to the temple of the Dryads, who 

were the nymphs of trees and of the forest and whose Hires- 

wxe associated with that of Iheir own tree, and ceased when the 

1 } 

tree died. At this point Goethe still sees nature through 

the eyes of the Anacreontics. Nature has neither meaning 

nor beauty for its own sake. It is introduced merely to give 

the impression of a classical-anacreontic setting. Nature is 

inanimate with the exception of the birds hopping from branch 

to branch. These birds remind us of the reference in Gleim’s 

Die Erinnerung to the nightingale whose song the lovers hear 

2 ) 

from their retreat. 

A still night, a secluded hide-away and two young 

people — here are all the ingredients for romance. Soon 

the couple feels more than the customary ’T&ndelei*. The 

girl is the first to declare her love: 

Des M&dgens zMrtlich Herz lag ganz in ihrem Blikke, 
Halbl&chelnd nennt sie ihn ihr bestes grdstes Glttkke. 1 * 3 ' 

Daphnis is not slow to return the same feeling. With each 

kiss his blood becomes more and more inflamed and his advances 

become bolder and bolder. Such rapture sets his senses reeling

and he fails to notice that the girl no longer responds to 

his caresses* Her formerly cheery glance is now filled with 

1 ) 

apprehension. Daphnis, "zulezt von Wollust trunken", 
believes the decisive moment is at hand and calls on Amor 
to grant him final victory. But the girl, tearing herself 
from his arms, jumps up and beseeches Daphnis to take pity 
on her and go away. 

One of the most interesting features of the poem is 

the increasing tempo of the love scenes. The first reference 

2 ) 

"von stiller Wollust eingeladen" suggests emotion which is 

suppressed and under firm control. The mention of "zgrtlich" 

and "t&ndelnd" suggests playing with feeling rather than a 

release of real emotion. The next reference implies that 

restraint under such favorable conditions would be unnatural: 

Wem Amor solch ein Glttkke giebt, 

Wird der nicht me hr als sonsten ftthlen? \ 

Und unser Paar fieng bald an mehr zu ftthlen. 3; 

Soon passion rules unchecked, defying the conventions which 

it formerly reverenced: 

Und wenn das Blut einmal von Liebe sehwillt, ^ 

Reisst es gar leicht der Ehrfurcht Granzen nieder.' 

After a fiery love scene the conclusion comes as a surprise.

Goethe has broken with the anacreontic tradition by stopping 

the consummation of passionate love. Only the girl, however, 

can restrain herself; the young man remains dumbfounded and 

trembling. The girl tactfully implies that it was the 

situation rather than his own lack of self-control which led 

him astray. Her last words sum up the moral: 

0 Freund, ich liebe dich zu sehr, 

Um dich unwttrdig zu verlieren. ) 

It is nothing shameful to love and lose but it is unworthy 

of a human being to lose through lack of self-control. 

This poem shows strong anacreontic influence in the 
pastoral setting, plot and wording. Goethe falls back on 
such favorite words as **Taxus M , "Eiche”, "heisses Blut tf , 
n drtlken ?t , "durchgltthen", "Feuer**, and ”verfi2hren ft . The 
following linesfin particular recalls Gleim*s delight in 
delineating the female body: 

Konnt* Daphnis wohl dem Reiz des Busens wiederstehn? 

Bey 3edem Kusz durchglftht ihn neues Feuer, 

Bey jedem Kusse ward er freyer. 1 2 ' 

The ending and moral, however, are Goethe*s own.

Triumph der Tug end. Zwote Erzghlung . 

Although the preceding tale is still basically 
anacreontic, this tale marks a strong departure from the 
frivolous sense of values to which the Anacreontics ascribed. 
Goethe's glowing power of expression becomes increasingly 
evident here. 

A young man, visiting his sweetheart one evening, 
chances to find her alone in the house. What is more, he 
comes upon her as she stands unclothed before the mirror. 

Rot at all suspecting that she is being observed, she 
adorns herself, to the delight of the young man. Unable 
to contain himself any longer, he springs forth from his 
vantage point and attempts to embrace her. Furious and 
fearful at the same time, she tries to rebuff him with one 
hand and to cover herself with the other. She cries to him 
to leave if he ever expects her to forgive his rashness. 

1) 

But the young man, "von heisser Glut durchdrungen", 
has been too deeply stirred to stop now. He determines to 
make the most of the opportunity for he can be certain it 
will never come again. Tenderly drawing her to him, he

embraces her once more. Since the girl is silent, the young 
man concludes, wrongly as the reader soon learns, that her 
repulsion is giving way to passion. He dares to become even 
bolder. But his exultation is frustrated just as it reaches 
its peak for the girl applies the last resort which no man 
can withstand. She bursts into tears: 

Fast - fast - doch des Sieges Lauf 
Hielt schnell ein gl&h'nder Strom von Thr&nen 
Unwiederstehlich auf. 1 2 ^ 

There is, however, no humor in the situation. Throwing her 
arms about his neck, she implores him to save her. He is 
the only one who can. All past happiness means nothing for 
now begins her misery. With horror she sees in her mind f s 
eye the grim predictions, which her mother made, being 
fulfilled. But her mother cannot help her now. Her fate 
lies in the hands of the young man. 

In desperation she prays to God in his dwelling of 
innocence, to pity her and snatch her from destruction. The 
climax of the poem is reached when she realizes that the 
young man is too weak to repress the emotions surging 
through him: 

Du 

Yermagst * s allein; der ist zu schwach dazu, 

Der Mensch, zu dem ich vor dir betete. '

Her prayer seems to steel her courage for she dares to 
taunt the young man to his face. In a marvellous simile she 
compares men like him to a flower cutter and her innocence 
to a flower. They would kill the flower as their unfeeling 
hand strikes it down. Their scorn, as their foot victoriously 
grind the flower into the dust would constitute its second 
death. 


Naht euch, Yerftthrer^ deren Wange nie 
Yon heil’gem Graun errtfthete, 

Wenn eure Hand geftlhllos, wie 

Die Schnitter Blumen, Unschula tddete, 

Und euer Siegerfusz darttber tretend, sie 
Durch Hohn zum zweyten Male tBdete, 

Naht euch.^' 

The first death, betrayal of confidence, can be endured because 
once it is over it can be crowded out of one’s mind. The 
second death, scorn, is however by far the greater of the two 
evils because it rubs against the hurt and conjures up again and 
again the old images of shame and fear. 


The taunt does the trick because it makes the young man 
see his act for what it really is - not love but sheer 
selfishness. Slowly he realizes that he is hurting a human 
being who can feel pride and modesty just as he can: 

Wehe dem, der dann 
Noch einen Wunsch zu ihrem Elend wollen, 

Noch einen Schritt zum Raube wagen kannl 1 2 )

It is indeed a blow when the great lover is disillusioned. 
Completely nonplussed and unable to find words to express 
himself, he tears himself away and flees the house. 

The tale resumes the next day when the young man finds 
his sweetheart and her mother singing songs of innocent love. 
Leading him aside, the girl tells him that he is now able to 
face the world confidently for he despises neither her nor 
himself. According to the saying^ f Yirtue is its own reward 1 . 
This is not quite accurate in this case for in the girl's 
own words: 

Freund, dieses ist der Tugend Lohn; 

0, w&rst du gestem thr&nend nicht entflohn, 

Du sghst mich heute . 

Und ewig nie mit Freude.-^' 

According to Goethe, virtue's reward is peace of mind and a 
warm glow in one's heart. 

The most noteworthy idea in this poem is Goethe's 
attitude to love. Here love involves something deeper and 
more earnest, something over and above the sensual. Whereas 
in Lyde he advocates moderation in love as in all things, in 
this poem, as the title states, he praises virtue. Love is 
the age old struggle between flesh and spirit. But the struggle 
is now not as one-sided as in Triumph der Tugend, erste

•.rzffhlung . In this poem the woman strives to remain virtuous, 

begging both her lover and God to pity her, and in addition 

the young man is filled with new principles of honor and 

decency which give him the strength to flee an inviting 

situation. The source of true happiness does not lie in the 

bliss of sensual love as in Ziblis , but in virtue and self 

control. This moral conclusion makes the reader pause and 

reflect, in contrast to the poems of Gleim, Uz or Gdtz which 

contain very little food for thought. Goethe the moralist 

cannot refrain from offering advice to young girls. He implies 

that in matters of love 1 silence gives consent 1 and that men 

are not mind-readers. 

0 MMdgen, soil mit list f gen Streichen 
Hein Jtlngling seinen Zweck erreichen. 

So mtlsst ihr niemals ruhig schweigen, 

'enri ihr mit ihm alleine seyd. 1 ' 

His moral observations have taken on a note of earnestness which 
is lacking in Ziblis and Lyde . 

The lack of humor in the poem strikes the reader 
immediately. The whole tale is rather like a scene in a court¬ 
room where the girl is pleading her case against the young 
man and where God is the judge. Her testimony seems to be 
as truthful as if she were under oath. Unlike such heroines

as Ziblis, Lyde and Charlotte, she acts as she feels. She is 

modest by nature and when her lover wants to take advantage 

of her embarrassment she acts accordingly: 

Zorn sprach ihf furchtsam wilder Blikk, 

Die eine Hand sties mich zurtlkk, _ , 

Die andre dekte das, was ich nicht sehen sollte."^ 

She is not coquettish as is Gleim f s favorite heroine Doris ' 

but expresses true feeling. The Anacreontics, on the other 

hand, fail to convince the reader that they are dealing with 

real life situations. Completely unanacreontic too is the 

reference to the Christian God instead of Cupid or one of the 

lesser divinities. This poem, then, marks the high point of 

the ones analysed so far for both the thought behind it and 

the authenticity of the feeling make it t? echt goethisch." 

But what of the wording? To what degree is it 

individual? Upon examination we discover anacreontic symbols 

in abundance. This passage reveals the conventional 

preoccupation with the female form: 

Des Busens voile -Blttten wies 
Sie dem verschwiegnen kaltexi Spiegel, liesz 
Das Kaar getheilt von ihrem Scheitei fallen, x 

- Vie Dosenzweig* urn Knospen, urn den Busen wallen. '

Even though Goethe is still bound by conventional phrases, 
we see some of his later images previewed here in splendid 
comparisons. One of the most vivid similes is this: 

Wie Wellen auf dem Meer, 

Desz Grund erbebte, schlug die Brust, dem Munde 
Entrauscht f ein Stum. 1 ' 

In a powerful image he compares the lover to Diana’s 
hunt sman: 

So stand Diane ns. J£ger muthig da. 

Triumph gen Himmel hauchend, als er sah, . 

Was ungestraft kein Sterblicher noch sah. 2 ' 

Goethe makes use of such cliches as F’Glut”, ’’Sehnen”, 

"Zartlichkeit", "Sieg”, "Herz", ft Busen M , "Wange”, «Seufzer« # 

"umarmen”, n brennen ff , "stftrzen”, ’’zwingen”, ’’hervorspringen" 

and n fliehen”. Because he uses anacreontic terms as symbols 

of true emotion, we can say that in this poem Goethe rises 

above the sphere of the anacreontic as represented by Gleim 

and Uz. Compared to his later writing, however, this poem 

is still clearly a youthful attempt. 

Although the T Peeping Tom and Lady Godiva f motif is 
strongly anacreontic, Goethe’s interpretation of the mother’s 
role is original. Instead of being a heartless creature who 
locks her daughter up every night to preserve her virtue, 


1) Goethe: erke , III; 195, 64-66. 

2) Ibid., 194, 31-35. 







88 


she is her companion and confidante. The daughter does not 
despise her advice as does Lyde, but profits by her experience. 
The mother comes to life as a recognizable human being in 
that scene of domestic harmony as she and her daughter sing 
some of the good old songs. 


Elegie * 


This poem is ostensibly a, lament on the death of the 
brotther of Goethe's friend Behrisch. In reality it presents 

the reactions of two people to his death and a tirade 

« 

against a system in which absolute power is invested in one 

man. The first stanza is interesting for two reasons. 

Im dfistern Wald, auf der gespaltnen Eiche, 

Die einst der Banner hingestrekt. 

Sing' ich um deines Bruders Leiche, , 

Die fern von uns ein fremdes Grab bedekt. 1 ' 

The first line is a conventional treatment of nature and is 

the only such reference in the poem. The description of the 

- 

gloomy forest is fitting for an elegy, as it sets a solemn

tone. The symbol of the fallen oak split in two by the 

lightning is obviously intended to be an allusion to the 

strength of mind of the dead man. The third and fourth 

lines are, in contrast, more in the style of the epic than 

of the elegy. They remind us of the beginning of Virgil’s 

Aeneid: Tt Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris 

1) 

Italiam...." 

The dead man had apparently devoted himself to his 
work until far into the prime of his life and had consoled 
himself that very soon he would reap the rewards of his labor. 
But he reckoned without death which relentlessly bore him 
away. Goethe contrasts the reactions of the deceased’s 
brother and fiancee to his untimely death. Behrisch does 
not weep, Goethe explains, because God let his brother 
precede him to Heaven and he can do nothing but envy him. 

This attitude need not be religious, but it is rational. 

After all, his brother is dead and gone. What good will 
mouring do him now? This response, particularly with its 
reference to the Supreme Being, is more philosophical than 
any which the Anacreontics would give. They preferred not 
to talk about death, even though now and then its icy shudder 
runs through their scenes of merry-making. For them life 
was to be lived as quickly and as joyfully as possible.

What is the reaction of the dead man's fiancee? 

She cannot restrain her feelings. She has thrown herself 

beside the newly filled grave where she pours out her grief 

in heart breaking sobs. Her only comfort is her faith in 

God's justice. This faith springs from a sincere conviction 

and not from mere expedience. 

Terlassen, ohne Trost l,iegt hie, 

Mit Sngstlicher Gebehrde 
Zu Gott gekehrt, als hofte sie, 

Das schOnste MSdgen an der Erde.-^ 

Her grief is so intense that it imparts a new meaning to love 

between the sexes. A man and a woman can love each other 

sincerely, without letting their feelings deteriorate into 

sensuality. This is an extension of the attitude to love 

which reaches its peax in Triumph der Tugend . Of the woman's 

love Goethe says: 

Denn nichts als eine heil'ge Liebe 
War dieser Unglttkseelfgen Schuld. ) 

The idea of innocent love, consummated only in marriage, is 

decidedly unanacreontic, where passion has full sway with no 

regard for convention. This love is, in fact, so pure that 

Goethe feels himself compelled to implore God to grant her 

prayer - either her fiance's life or her death. Unconventional 

too, is the implication of a future life.

The whole treatment of love here is unaxiaoreontic 
in that it places love between man and woman on a far higher 
plane than companionship between men. Goethe passes over 
Behrisch’ grief in four lines, but devotes four stanzas to 
an account of his sweetheart f s pain. Here would be a splendid 
opportunity to eulogize the ’Freundschaft’ cults so popular 
among Gleim, Jacobi and their followers. Goethe, however, 
does not see eye to eye with them on this point. As much 
as he likes the companionship of his fellow students, we 
infer from his letters that he likes female company better. 
Singing the praises of friendship among men is all right for 
middle-aged men with a flair for verse-making but it is not 
rich enough for Goethe’s young blood. 


The remainder of the poem is devoted to a detailed 

declamation against tyranny. Practically every line gives 

us an insight into young Goethe’s inquiring and rebellious 

spirit. He is not afraid to censure those who have been 

tried and found wantir^, not even God himself. Although He 

is all love and mercy His acts are not beyond question. 

0 Gott, bestrafest du die Liebe, 

Du We sen voller Lieb und Huld? 1 ' 

This censure is mild compared to the tongue lashing he gives

the dead man t s prince. Behrisch was, in fact, Councillor 
' 1 ) 
for Landgraf von Hessen-Philippstal at the time of his death. 

We learn that the Landgraf summoned him away just before his 

wedding day. Behrisch could do nothing but submit to this 

tyranny although it meant breaking his word to his beloved. 

Goethe contrasts the selfishness of the tyrant with the 
magnanimity of the subject. Behrisch realizes sadly that 
under this system of service he is not free to lead his own 
life: 

Als Mrger der bedrtagten Erde , 

Sprach er, kann ich nie deine seyn. 1 2 ' 

He can do no more than pledge to keep faith with his betrothed 

although he knows that they will never be united in this 

world. He is powerless by himself but later on others will 

band together to destroy this proud tyranny and others like 

it. Although his ruler f s selfishness is the cause of his 

death, he forgives his injustice to him personally, because 

his power will soon be overthrown. The prince f s law is life 

and death to his subjects. This is allowed him. But when he 

tries to regiment their thoughts and feelings, he oversteps 

his right, driving his subjects to revolt: 

0 Mrst, du kannst die Ivlenschen zwingen, 

Fttr dich allein ihr Leben zuzubringen^

Dooh willst du ihre Seelen binden, 

Durch dioh zu denken, zu empfinden. 

Das musz zu G-ott um Bacte schreyn. 1 ' 

Even though man's body is enslaved, his mind remains free. 

In this poem we recognize the later "Sttfrmer und Dr&nger”, 

who, in the name of the natural rights of man (in the sense 

of Bousseau and Montesquieu), fights for the liberation of 

the individual from the chains of absolutism. Above all he 

attacks the repression of freedom of thought and conscience 

by Church and State. 

All in all, this poem shows the least trace of 
anacreontic influence of the ones which have been examined up 
to this point. Although the first verse and the emphasis on 
the woman’s feelings is conventional and the vocabulary is 
not particularly rich in visual images, these weaknesses are 
more than offset by the intense feeling embodied in the 
mouring scene. The reader is convinced that the biother, 
the fiancee and Goethe himself genuinely regret Behrisch* 
death. Similarly the remonstrance at the end is highly 
effective because of its simplicity. There is no mistaking 
its fervor for forced praise.

Ode an Herrn Professor Zachariae. 


Goethe wrote this poem to lament the departure of 

1 ) 

Zachariae, who had been visiting in Leipzig at Easter 1769 
and who went to Braunschweig, where he was a professor at 
the Carolinum. Since Goethe calls Leipzig an "unbedau'rten 
Ort” we assume that this city did not pay the poet Zachariae 
as much homage as Goethe would have liked. Only Goethe 
appreciates the poet's gifts. He realizes that much of his 
own joy rides off with the poet, firmly chained to his 
carriage. 

Although Goethe nowhere gives us a description of the 
poet's personality, we infer that his intelligent and witty 
conversation kept him enthralled. In a spectacular double 
personification and simile he describes how vexation and 
boredom fled at the poet's arrival only to creep back at his 
departure : 

Du bist uns kaum entwichen, und sehwermttthig ziehen 
Aus dumpfen HOhlen (denn dahin 
Flohn sie bey deiner Ankunft, wie fttr'm Gltthen 
Der Sonne Nebel fliehn) 

Verdrusz und Langeweile.2) 

The image becomes even more complex as Goethe compares the

vexation and boredom to the Stymphalids who be spoiled the 
food of Phineus: 

Wie die Stymphaliden 
Umschw&rmen sie den Tisoh, und sprtthn 
Von ihren Fittigen Gift unserm Frieden 
Auf alle Speisen hin. ' 

This reference to mythology confuses the legend of the 

Stymphalids with that of the Harpies* The Stymphalids were 

birds which had the power to shoot feathers from their wings 

like arrows. Hercules encountered them on his adventures and 
2 ) 

killed them. The reference to the befouling of the food 

belongs properly to the Harpies legend. According to one 

version Zeus had to punish Phineus, king of Salmydessus for 

misuse of his prophetic power. He gave him the choice of 

death or blindness. When Phineus chose the latter, Helios 

(the Sun) was so offended that he sent the Harpies to steal 

3) 

or defile Phineus 1 2 3 4 food so that he almost died of hunger. 


Even Goethe’s respect for Zachariae as a poet is 
expressed in classical terms. With him has fled love in 

the form of Amor ”der Venus vielgeliebter Sohn, Apollo’s 

4) 

Liebling, Liebling aller Getter”. As if this is not 
praise enough he is reported to have received his poetic

gift in the shape of a lyre directly from the hands of the 
great Apollo himself. But young Goethe cannot remain serious 
for too long. He claims that if he himself touched this 
lyre, monsters would flee to Hades at the sound of his 
disharmonies: 

Ich rtlhrte sie, dann flflhiL die Ungeheuer 
Erschrdkt zur H811 r hinab. ' 

But Goethe does not really have such a poor opinion of his 
talent. He fondly believes that if Zachariae, the darling 
of the Muses, should come to love him, surely then the Muses 
would love him too. 

There is no doubt that Goethe is rapidly gaining 
confidence in his ability. He has come face to face with 
his potentialities. He must decide if his talent is really 
genius or just mediocrity. In a letter to his sister on 
May 11, 1767, he sums up this whole problem. "...Habe ich 
Genie, so werde ich Poete werden, und wenn mich kein Mensch 

2) 

verbessert; habe ich keins, so helfen alle Kritiken nichts." 

Returning to the classical motif again, Goethe begs the 
w Sohn der Maja n (Hermes) to lend him his winged sandals as he 
used to lend them to mortals in days gone by, so that he may

speed to Zachariae in Braunschweig* Hermes was the god of 
dreams, as well as herald of the gods and conductor of the 
souls of the dead to Hades. Goethe wants to walk beside 
Zachariae along the banks of the Okker River. He does not 
want to be entertained by his wit; he wants only to bask 
in the poet f s glory, which, he hopes, vail inspire him. 

The theme of the poem is basically anacreontic, 

stressing as it does the theme of friendship among men. 

Goethe does not, however, treat this motif with nearly as 

much sentimentality as does Gleim# As far as Gleim is 

concerned his friends are all "treue Brttder" who laugh and 

drink together in a convivial atmosphere and call each other 

1 ) 

pet names. Goethe's attitude to Zachariae is practically 
one of hero-worship. Besides the many classical allusions 
and references to'Venus, Amor, Apollo and Hermes, the 
following conventional expressions appear: "Freude", 
"gltlhen", "Sonne", "Liebling", "Gutter", "Leyer", "Busen", 
"lieben", and "Musen". He again tries to give the feeling of 
the classical-anacreontic world by using such archaic 
spellings as "bey", "erschrdkt", "gieng" and "umgiebt". 

There is little of Goethe in the poem except in the. three 
striking images already mentioned and in his wish to be as

accomplished as his teacher. 


An den Schlaf. 


In this poem Goethe once again falls back into 

conventional thought and terminology. The title itself 

conjures up a host of sensuous images and acts as a lure to 

draw the reader into the poem proper. The first stanza 

follows the standard ritual of an invocation, such as Virgil 

is fond of using. Sleep is addressed in the same tone as 

Venus or Cupid and is personified in the form of a powerful 

agent. In fact, with its tranquillizing qualities sleep 

sometimes overcomes even the gods and brings about the well- 

nigh impossible in matters of wealth and love; 

Der au mit deinem Mohne 
Selbst Gbtteraugen zwingst, 

Und Bettier oft zum Throne, . 

Zum Mftdgen Schafer bringst. 1 ' 

The narrator, tired of dream images which dissolve when he 
stretches forth his arms to embrace them, wants sleep to

perform its greatest service for him. He begs it to flash 

opium from its wings over the head of his sweetheart’s mother. 

The result would be a sound sleep for the mother and an 

undisturbed night for the lovers. Many is the time the 

mother has interrupted a cosy t§te-a-tHte; 

Oft hatte meinen Kttssen 
Sie Amor zugebracht, 

Diesz Gltick musz ieh vermissen, 

Die strenge Mutter wacht. ' 

Here again we recognize the "waehsame Mutter” motif. 

This is probably the most characteristic of all anacreontic 
motifs, as it Implies the whole idea of forbidden love. The 
motif, as presented here, is practically a paraphrase of the 
same idea in Lyde , except that in this poem the girl does not 
aid and abet her lover quite so obviously. With the exception 
of the invocation the whole poem is composed of nothing but 
love scenes. The expressions which had become trite even 
before Goethe began to borrow them appear in every line. He 
refers to "Gutter", "MStdgen", "Schafer", "verlangen", "Seite", 
"Auge", "Lust", "neidisch", "ftthlbar", "Brust", "Etlsse", "Amor", 
"Glttck", "strenge Mutter", "Abend", "einschlafen", "Liebe", 

"warm", and "gierig". Annette’s name is mentioned for the third 
time. By and large the poem can be rated as "rein anakreontisch"•

Pygmalion, eine Komanze . 


Here Goethe has turned his talent to a variation of 

the Pygmalion myth. According to Greek mythology, Pygmalion 

was a sculptor-xing of Cyprus who carved out of ivory a 

1 ) 

statue of a maiden, which Aphrodite endowed with life. The 
subtitle, "a romance”, makes it clear, which part of the 
myth Goethe is going to stress. 

The first line sets the tone of the stoiy: 

2 ) 

Es war einmal ein Hagenstolz. 

We are told of the hero’s occupation, sculpting, only in the 
third line. This surprising interest in Pygmalion’s marital 
status leads the reader to suspect anacreontic treatment of 
the old theme and this is exactly what he gets. We learn 
further that sculpting is more than his hobby; it is his 
whole pleasure in life. The next lines, which describe his 
abstinence from the bohemian round of wine, women and song, 
only too often associated with artists, seem to echo dismay 
and unbelief: 

Kein junges schdnes sanftes Weib 
Erwtante seine Brust. '

Surprisingly enough he has no sweetheart because he does not 

choose to have one. He considers himself too clever to be 

caught in a designing female’s snares and too skeptical to 

fall for loving words: 

Denn er war klug und furchte sehr 
Der Hdrner schwer Gewicht; 

Denn schon seit vielen Jahren.her 
Traut man den Weibern nicht. ' 

The phrase "der Hdrner schwer Gewicht" (the heavy weight of 

the horns) may be a reference to the expression "dem 

Ehemann Geweihe aufsetzen", which has to do with a wife’s 

deception of her husband. ("To horn a husband" meant to 

cuckold in archaic English.) Since Pygmalion does not wish 

to be deceived he determines to stay clear of temptation. 

He is, however, by no means insensible to feminine 

beauty. In fact he sculpts statue after statue of female 

forms in wood, marble and clay. One statue is clearly his 

masterpiece. It excels everything that he has ever done 

before because in it he has crossed the demarcation line 

between imagination and reality. Although carved from hard, 

cold stone, the girl seems to be alive and soft and warm. 

Her beauty.invites a caress: 

Die hohe Brust, der weisse Arm 
Lud zur Umarmung ein. 1 2 '

Her charm consists not at all of serene radiance but rather 

of a tempting roguishness: 

Das Auge war empor gewandt, 

Halb auf zum Kusz der Mund. 1 ' 

But the artist would probably have done no more than quietly 

admire this statue, as he had done countless others, if it 

were not for Amor. The little god, seeing a chance to raise 

mischief, wounds him with one of his arrows. Immediately he 

becomes a slave of love, and, blind to reality, he embraces 

the statue passionately. He is so infatuated that he 

believes the statue is alive. It is only when he sees his 

position through a friend*s eyes that he realizes his mistake 

Da trat ein guter Freund herein, 

Und sah dem Narren zu, 

Sprach: Du umarmest harten Stein, 

0 welch ein Thor bist dul 2 ) 

Although his friend makes fun of Pygmalion*s foolishness, he 
does not seem to be greatly surprised at his behavior. On 
the contrary, he probably feels relieved that Pygmalion will 
now forego his he unit-like existence and become a *regular 
fellow*. In fact he even promises to give him his mistress. 
Pygmalion agrees. So powerful is the love potion of Aaor*s 
dart that the sculptor is ready to fall in love with the 
first woman he sees:

1 ) 

Er gltlhte schon eh er sie sah, 

Apparently the girl makes him happy for the next line says: 

2 ) 

Jetzt glttht er zweymal me hr. 

Up to now the tale has been a happy (at least by 
anacreontic standards) story of the belated awakening of a 
man’s desire. Now the tone changes. The poem becomes a 
tale of woe and a lesson for others. Pygmalion, enraptured 
by his newly discovered bliss, loses his head. He rushes 
off and marries his mistress. This behavior is completely 
incomprehensible to Goethe, who tries to explain it away 
with the words: 

3) 

Man ist nicht immer klug. 

The story ends on a mournful note. Beware of Pygmalion’s 

fate. Do not live like a recluse, believing your heart 

steeled against feminine chanas. Above all, do not be a 

woman-hater. In so doing, you are leaving yourself 

unprotected against Anor’s arrows and when they hit you, you 

will probably be so distracted you will rush headlong into 

a fate worse than death. And that is marriage. 

Wer wild ist, alle MSdgen flieht, 

Sich unempfindlich glaubt, 

Dem ist, wenn er ein M&dgen sieht,

1 ) 

Das Herze gleich geraubt. 

All precautions are in vain for there is. no sure way to avoid 

falling in love. Goethe, tongue in cheek, cannot help 

remarking in graveyard humor: 

Und wenn euch Amor einmal kriegt, 

Darin ist es aus mit euch* 1 2 ) 

Although there is no way to keep out of love, there is one 

way to stay single and gay. Be a man about town. Be a Don 

Juan. In this way you can have the time of your life and 

never be caught. But if you fail to follow this advice, only 

misery will be your lot because: 

Sonst straft euch Amor ganz gewisz, 

Und giebt euch eine Brau. 3 ' 

To the twentieth century reader, the most interesting 
feature of the poem is the attitude to marriage. By eighteenth 
century standards marriage is purely a matter of convenience 
or economic necessity. A man marries to have children to 
carry on the family name and inherit the family heirlooms. 

Or he may seek a suitable match in order to use his wife’s 
dowry to double his fortune or to set himself up in business. 

If he is physically attracted to his bride-to-be, so much 
the better. If not, it does not matter much, because he is

sure to find congenial company elsewhere. A young man is 
perfectedly justified in chasing women, just because he is a 
man. This double morality standard existed long before the 
emancipation of women, in the days when a girl was to 
consider herself flattered if a young man so much as looked 
twice at her. She was always to remember that the man was 
lord and master. If he should make overtures which on the 
surface did not always appear too honorable, she was to 
overlook this and hope everything would work out for the 
best. After all, the young man, if she succeeded in 
marrying him, would ensure her bread and butter. Perhaps 
in time she could learn to be fond of him. Perhaps not. 

This poem contains several of the favorite conventional 
motifs, chief among them being the basic element of passion. 
In.this connection Goethe uses many words which are designed 
to incite the senses, as for example, "Lust", "erw&rmen", 

"hohe Brust", "MSdgen", "Schdnheit", "weich", "warm", 

"weisser Arm", "Umarmung", "Kusz", "Mund", "Liebe", "Glut", 
"gltthen", and "kttssen". The best single example of words 
carefully selected for their visual and tactile imagery is 
"junges schdnes sanftes Weib". Like Gleim in many of his 
poems, in Pygmalion Goethe sets up as a model a certain way 
of life. Here it is even gayer and more bohemian because 


the hero is an artist

In this poem too, the motif of ’Freundschaft’ is 
touched upon. What truer friend could exist than one who 
would sacrifice his own mistress to satisfy a friend? Upon 
closer inspection the reader realizes that the friend’s 
argument is too pat. He was probably tired of her anyway. 
This interpretation, although it reduces the f Freundschaft’ 
motif to nothing, does stress Goethe’s bounding personality 
which insists on having its say. All the way through the 
poem appear incidental remarks which are unmistakably 
’’goethisch’i In addition to his ’ cuckold’-image, we find his 
observation: 

Ein M&dgen, das lebendig ist, 

Sey besser als von Stein. • 

These remarks gain their effect from their position rather 
than from their astuteness. Often, as is the case with the 
conclusion, they are gems of incongruity. The form 
Pygmalion’s punishment takes - a wife - is so unlike what 
the reader anticipates, that it leaves him dumbfounded. 

Goethe’s personality again shows through in the length 
of the moral. It is doubtful if Gleim or Uz could compose 
a four stanza moral that would hold the reader’s attention. 

In summary, we can say that this poem, although anacreontic

asides. Pygmalion indeed gives promise of the more mature 
poet • 


)ie Liebhaber. 


This poem tells the story of the way in which a young 
man wins his true love through the assistance of the dream 
god* A girl is lying in the arbor in the shade of purple 
foliage and festooning herself with twined vines. Languishing, 
she Yvaits for her lover. The dream god, coming upon her as 
she sleeps, embraces her. The girl, believing that she is 
in her lover's arms, responds to his kisses. Goethe uses 
here the device of mistaken identity to further the plot. 

The dream becomes more complex and more fanciful. The girl 
is suddenly surrounded by people who for some unknown 
reason are sighing and pining for life. The symbolism 
becomes more involved. The crowd has fallen on its knees 
and is crying piteously to the girl, whose ego is flattered 
by so much attention. She thinks she must be a queen to 












108 

merit such veneration# But she does not mean an earthly 
queen, but Venus, classical queen of love and beauty# This 
is a true anacreontic touch# 

Again the scene changes and she catches sight for the 
first time of the "schrekliche Sieger”, who is lying cowed, 
like a shackled prisoner# Only the girl can release the 
warrior by choosing him as her lover# His courtship is 
hardly conventional. He does not begin by telling her how 
much he cares for her but tells her how much courage her 
presence gives him; 

Da fttrcht ich nicht wall 1 nieht Canonen, 

Nicht Tonnen, die Minen bewohnen, 

Nicht Feinde, die schaarenweis ziehn, . 

Du sprichst nur: Entfliehtf - sie entfliehn# 1 ' 

But the chained victor hastens to add that he is not just a 
blood and thunder warrior but is also the most tender hearted 
lover imaginable. 

Other admirers appear, speak their piece and apparently 
drop out of the picture. First a stodgy merchant kneels and 
tries to bribe the girl with furs and splendid materials, to 
consider his proposal: 

Dich hie id* ich in herrlicher Pracht . 

Dann, wenn du mich gltlklich gemacht. 2 '

His appeal to her love of fine things is unsuccessful. 

Next a fop, ostentatiously deemed out in velvet and 

brocaded silk appeals to her love of rank. He might not 

possess the merchants wealth but he knows all the right 

people. As his wife, she will cut a fine figure when they 

appear at balls and concerts. 

Du gltazest bey Ball und Goncerten, . 

Du herrschest beyra Spiel und in G&rten. ' 

The reader, as well as the girl, finds it hard to take the 

dandy seriously for he ham summend, wie K&fer im May, 

2 ) 

mit k&nstlichen Sprtlngen herbey”. 

Other suitors appear. Perhaps the dream god fears that 

the girl is weakening. At any rate he shoves the narrator 

forward just as the girl stirs restlessly and calls out his 

name. Her lover springs forward and kisses her. She awakes 

in his aims and the nightmare is forgotten. The bliss of the 

two young people is indescribable l

Vertumnus and Pomona. Vertumnus was the Roman god of 
orchards and fruit who wooed Pomona in a succession of 

I) 

various forms - as a reaper, ploughman, pruner of vines, etc. 

The opening lines, which describe the setting, are 

particularly full of sensuous images and deserve to be quoted 

because they demonstrate probably the point of greatest 

influence of the anacreontic in Goethe’s language: 

Mein MSdgen im Schatten der Laube 
Umhangen von purpurner Traube 
Bekrtazte mit Rebenlaub sich 
Bnd wartete schmachtend auf rnich. 2 ' 

Here as in the poems of Gleim and Uz the setting is not 

described in great detail. Granted that mention of a tree 

is almost indespensible, the reader is not told what kind it 

is. Just to talk of foliage is not enough. There have to 

be purple clusters of grapes to catch the eye and suggest 

bubbling wine. Goethe is indeed very much under the spell 

of the ancreontic tradition when he can conventionalize 

nature like this. He uses nature in this poem as a stage 

manager would a prop in a drama. It is necessary to introduce 

the story and it is very pretty to glance back at now and 

again. It is, however, not an appreciation or even an 

understanding of nature. At this stage in Goethe’s develop-

ment, beauty of nature takes second place to beauty of women. 

The beginning and end of the poem abound in 

conventional expressions. Just a few of these are "Schatten 

der Laube", "Traube", "Rebenlaub”, "schmachtend”, "umarmen”, 

"ktissen", "Wange", "gltthen", "Yerlangen”, "Brust", "Entzttkken" 

and TT sprdde”. Upon seeing these same words again and again 

the reader feels that this has all been said before. The 

description of the crowd is, however, worthy of note: 

Schnell war sie von Leuten umgeben, 

Die schmachteten seufzend nach Leben, 

Und harreten zitternd aufs Glftck 
Yon einem beseelenden Blick. ' 

This passage could have been written by Novalis, Tieck, 
Brentano or practically any of the German Romanticists. It 
might be interesting to compare the two movements very 
briefly, stressing their common features. The very subject 
matter, which the Anacreontics made their own, limited 
them, whereas the Romanticists twisted the same theme in 
endless ways. Both were, however, opposed to the world of 
everyday affairs; both set up a world of their own. The 
anacreontic and the romantic tradition both represented a 
revolt against intellectualism, the first against Gottsched's 
literary dictatorship, the second against the Rationalism

of the Enlightenment and the imitation of Classicism. Both 
emphasized the emotional aspects of the human personality at 
the expense of the logical faculties. 

The allegory-like quality of Die Liebhaber is as 
evident as it was in Ziblis . We are told that the girl is 
Annette: 

Da saugte mit athmenden Zttgen 
Annette das grflste Vergntlgen 
Der Tr&ume, die M&dgen erfreun* 

Vow Munde des GSttiichen ein. ' 

We can presume that the young man is Goethe. The f Trailingott * 

is not so easy to classify. It might be a dream phantom of 

the fiery, impatient Goethe who wants to speed up his love 

affair. Or it may simply be Amor conceived as the well- 

meaning, powerful assistant who furthers the cause of true 

love. 

The whole conception and language of the dream bears 
Goethe’s mark, although the dream setting was well liked by 
the Anacreontics. The latter fail, however, to place the 
reader inside the dream, so to speak, as Goethe does here. 

His characterizations are remarkably astute and amusing. All 
in all, the poem is a successful blend of anacreontic setting 
and sincere feeling. Goethe does not disguise the heroine

under such names as 'Phyllis* or * Doris* but calls her ”$ein

this poem was inspired by Goethe*s jealousy of Annette f s 
behavior toward the young men who dined in her parents 1 house.

This little poem is noteworthy chiefly because it is 

1 ) 

the oldest in the collection. Goethe reports a meeting 
between Doris and Bamdt. Both soon become starry-eyed and 
seem oblivious to their surroundings. But tbey obviously 
know what they are doing for they stop billing and cooing 
long enough to look around to see if the girl's parents 
are awake. Fo one is stirring. The coast is clear. They 
dash off and here the narrator discreetly breaks off with 
the coy remark: 

Und da sie niemand sahn, g 

Geschwind - Genug sie machtens, wie wins machen.

There can be little doubt that this roguish insinuation 
refers bach to the title and implies a comparison between 
the two sets of lovers^Doris and Darndt, and Annette and 
Goethe. 

The reader recognizes this coyness as a sample of 
anacreontic Emotion*. Sven at a cursory glance the attitude 
to love and life strikes him as being insincere. The 
characters are playing their way through life instead of 
living it. But even their play is not whole-hearted. The 
exaggerated situations, (of which there are many), do not 
appear melodramatic, as they would if the characters threw 
themselves into their roles, simply because the young men 
and their lady loves cannot sustain one mood very long. 

They tire quickly and want to play something else. This is 
not emotion but exploitation of feeling on the part of the 
anacreontic writers. Their aim, as is Goethe's here, is 
to shock the unsuspecting reader. When all is said and 
done it is doubtful how well they succeed. Probably not 
more than a few twentieth century readers would raise an 
eyebrow at the insinuations implied in anacreontic poetry 
generally and at this poem in particular. The world has 
always had a ready, if limited, market for the risqu£ 

since everyone likes to think himself more daring and 
adventurous than he really is. In this respect the more

extreme examples of anacreontic poetry can be said to be 
escapist literature. 

Anne tie an ihren Geliebten is interesting when 
considered as part of the process of Goethe’s development 
but is of little literary value otherwise. The ’wachsame 
Mutter 1 motif, the insinuations and the language are all 
conventional. It can be safely said that it contains 
nothing purely ’goethisch*. 


a einen jungen Prahler . 

Goethe addresses this rebuke to a young man, with 
whom we assume he was personally acquainted, although we 
are not told this specifically. The young man in question, 
as both the opening line and the title prove, is a 
braggart. He has even boasted to the narrator about his 
attraction for women, and particularly about the favors he 
has won from Phillis: 

Dir hat, wie du mir selbst erz&hlt, 

Es riie an Phillis Gunst gefehlt. 

Du sprichst, dir hab sie viel erlaubt,

G-oethe is saying that a person would have to be pretty small

Although G-oethe disguises the girl f s name under, the 
conventional 'Phillis', this poem is decidedly unanacreontic 
Anacreontic poetry claims no other motive than amusing the 
reader* The chief purpose of this poem, however, is not 
to amuse but to reprove. It expresses no sensual delight 
and none of the conventional motifs. Even the words 
themselves do not carry the connotation which is associated 
with the typical anacreontic word stock. Nor is the 
attitude to love conventional. This is a serious situation 
and is treated in a serious tone, without the slightest 
trace of humor. Love is not frivolous as in An den Schlaf . 
Neither is it playful as in Annette an ihren G-eliebten . 

It involves rather the observance of a standard of ethics

which is part and parcel of our society. This is the view of 
respectable citizens of Leipzig or anywhere else. 


rigal 


The title Madrigal suggests that a short amatory poem 
is to follo?i?. In this case, however, Goethe is applying the 
word in the musical sense of a part song for several voices. 
Although the piece consists of only a question and answer, 
the reader is captivated by its grace and wit. The girl 
remarks that she has just seen handsome Olind. In fact, she 
adds, she stopped short to gaze at and admire him. This 
is not just a young girl's fancy, she maintains, because 
anyone else would have done the same* She then asks her 
friend if he feels annoyed because she looked at another man. 

At this point the reader asks himself why the girl 
began this conversation in the first place. Perhaps she 
has a guilty conscience and is trying to justify her 

behavior both to herself and to the young man. Or possibly 
she relates the incident just to make her sweetheart jealous. 










118 

If the latter interpretation is correct, the incident may 
well be based on a real event. We know from Goethe's letters 
that Annette loved to tease him like this. 

Instead of rebuffing her, the young man turns the 

whole incident into a joke. He claims that he is never 

jealous, no matter how often she praises handsome men. 

He does not take her words seriously for if she loved only 

handsome men, as she claims, she would never have loved him: 

Derm liebest du die schdnen Leute, 

Sprich, hottest du mieh je geliebt? 1 ) 

Goethe must be sure of KMthchen's love if he can let himself 

be the butt of his own jokes. Although the theme of love 

identifies this poem, as anacreontic, its allegorical quality 

sets it far above the love poems of Gleim, Uz or Gbtz. An 

allegory must be built on a real situation. This element 

of a'factual basis, which underlies the action, is entirely 

lacking in the works of the Anacreontics. It gives the poem 

a personal touch even though Goethe dresses the story in 

such conventional words as fT M&dgen% ?, Geliebter ff , "Herz", 

"ftlhlen", w Mund tt , tf Sch6nheit tf and ?, lieben Tf .

j ^as Schreyen. Nach dem Italiflnischen . 

This little poem depicts an event in a typical 
anacreontic love scene. The narrator follows his sweetheart 
into a grove where he can embrace her unobserved. But the 
I girl demands that he leave her alone, and threatens to scream 
if he does not. Not believing her protestations for a minute, 
the young man raises his voice and vows to kill the first 
person who disturbs them. His strategy achieves the response 
which he expects. The girl signals him to hush so that no 
one may hear him: 

Still, winkt sie lispelnd, Liebster, still, 

Damit dich niemand h8rt. 5 

Here we recognize the motif of the coy girl as in Kunst , 
die Sprflden zu fangen and in Lyde . Her behavior does not 
fool anyone, especially not the young man. He interprets 
it, and rightly so, as a f go ahead signal* and the reader 
assumes that he does just that. 

As the subtitle indicates, this poem is not Goethe’s 
own, but an adaptation from the Italian. It embodies no 
important thought and, apart from illustrating Goethe’s 
skill in transposing ideas from one language to another,

of their love. The narrator claims that he foresaw the whole 

situation and offered advice, which, if followed, would 

have solved everything:

free translation from one of the love poems of la Sabiiere. 

Like the poems of Gleim and Uz it tries to reproduce the 

classical world, as seen through anacreontic eyes, by using 

classical names. According to Greek mythology Clymene was 

2 ) 

the mother of Phaethon. Hymen was the Greek and Homan 
god of marriage. This madrigal and the next are taken from 
a collection entitled Elite de poesies fugitives and are 
interesting chiefly because they prove that Goethe was 
acquainted with the anacreontic poetry of other countries 
besides Germany.

The narrator recounts a particularly vivid dream he has just 
had. He dreams he is elevated to the rank of king. Feeling 
that now perhaps he might be worthy of his sweetheart’s love, 
he throws himself at her feet and boldly declares his 
feelings. The dream ends. Yet not everything has been 
imagination. His realm and power are gone but his newly 
won love remains. 

This charming little poem, originally by Voltaire, 

is built on the favorite anacreontic device of the dream in 

which the lover and his true love are united. As in Die 

Liebhaber the young man wooes the girl in his sleep and 

awakes to find his dream has become reality. Madrigal 

also expresses the motif of f Sichbescheiden* (satisfaction 

1) 

with simple things), as does Gleim’s Anakreon . The 
narrator does not wish for wealth or position and is not 
unhappy when these vanish. The moral of the story is: 
love is worth more than anything else in the world.

An meine Lieder. 


This poem marks the conclusion of the ’Annette Lieder’. 
In it, the most recent of the seventeen poems, Goethe looks 
back not only at the earlier poems but also at his three 
years in Leipzig. He realizes that his love for K&thchen 
Schtfnkopf, no matter how sincere, can never be fulfilled, 
for he must soon leave Leipzig. As he addresses his poems 
as they lie in front of him, the familiar lines conjure up 
recollections of the times he and Kfithchen spent together. 

He loves the poems, not because they are his own creations, 

1 ) 

but because they are "Zeugen meiner Frdhligkeit”. In 
retrospect these days appear as wonderful as the spring¬ 
time, even though we know from Goethe’s letters that they 
contained their share of disappointment as well. He 
sincerely regrets parting and realizes that such happy 
days will probably never returns 

Ach sie kdmmt gewisz nicht wieder, 

Die sex- Tage Frtthlingszeit ) 

He foresees that his friend Behrisch, *’der Freund der 

3) 

Scherze", will soon depart. A further note of melancholy

creeps in as Goethe sees the circle of friends breaking up. 

He is thinking particularly of Behrisch and wondering if 
he may not be sorry to leave K&thchen as well as his friend 
Goethe: 

Ach, dasz auch vielleicht diesz Herze 

Bald um meine Liebste weintl 1 ) 

But unhappiness cannot last forever. After the first grief 
of parting is over, Goethe hopes, K&thchen may be reminded 
of the joy they shared together whenever her eye falls on 
these songs written in her honor. Time will wipe out the 
unpleasant memories and leave only the gay ones. 

An meine hieder shows no trace of anacreontic influence. 
To be sure, Goethe uses such words as "meine Liebste", 
"Herze”, "Auge" and "Freuden", but he uses them in their 
dictionary sense. There are no hidden undertones of meaning. 
He says what he feels. He does not try to hide his regret 
of parting under a veneer of frivolity. Neither does he 
resort to any classical images nor disguise the characters 
under mythological names. All the conventional motifs are 
absent. There is no coy girl, no stern mother, and no bold 
lover. Although the earlier poems with their classical 
allusions may be more intellectual and more polished,

Wolfgang Goethe had never been able to boast of a hardy- 
constitution. Even in Leipzig he had been seriously ill 
several times. One morning he awoke to find himself 
haemorrhaging badly. His friends nursed him devotedly. 
Although he had passed through the worst of the illness, he 
was still far from well when he returned home to Frankfurt 
and was soon confined to bed again. His chief pleasures 
during this T imprisonment T were sketching, composing, 
reworking older poems and probing the principles of art. He 
turned for help to the well read and highly educated 
Friederike Deser, with whom he had fallen in love while 
studying painting from her father. Goethe was a welcome 
guest at Professor Oeser r s country house in Dtflitz and he 
often called in for a visit while on short trips. Goethe 
sent Friederike a manuscript collection of his own poems 
and told her of another collection which was to be published 
under the title Neue nieder . Goethe f s friend Berhard Theodor 
Breitkopf had set the poems to music and could easily have 
them printed in his father’s printshop. 1 ' 

Let us now examine these poems to determine whether 
they still contain anacreontic elements or whether they 
express Goethe’s own ideas.

Zueignung . 


The opening lines of Zueignung form a splendid 

introduction to the fileue Lieder . 

Da sind sie nuni Da haht ihr sie, 

Die Lieder, ohne 
Am Rand des Bachs 

In this passage Goethe tells how he composed the poems which 

follow at the edge of the brook, where love was held dear. 

Presumably he is using f brook f to symbolize a broader aspect 

of nature, such as forest, meadow, field and brook. He 

himself admits that these poems are weak in artistic effects. 

They represent a caprice of the moment; they were quickly 

conceived and quickly jotted down. He did not spend hours 

and days polishing each phrase until it glittered. It is 

just that he was young and in love; the poems simply arose 

in him of their own accord. 

Furthermore he did not write them in order to have them 
published. They are to be sung by any young person who 
feels light-hearted and gay on a fine day in spring. As 
much as he would like to, Goethe cannot join the young people 
and share their merriment, for the after-effects of his 
illness still confine him to bed. As he puts it, the

prescribed cure is taking unfair advantage of him: 

Jetzt drttckt ihm di&tet f sche Huh 
Den Daumen auf die Augen. 1 ' 

All he can do is look at the happiness of his friends half 
enviously, half knowingly and lament in verse. This 
lament takes the form of a moral. Not so long ago he, too, 
was happy and in love without any thought for the future. 

Now, however, he has discovered that all happiness has its 
limits: 

H8rt seine letzten Lehren anJ 
Er hat*s so gut wie ihr getan 
Und kennt des Glia ekes Grenzen. 2 ) 

He is not content to stand by and see his friends sighing, 

singing, languishing, kissing and shouting for joy, for he 

can see farther than they and can discern the abyss before 

their feet. His friends should think of more serious things, 

such as marriage, if they want their happiness to continue. 

Goethe can foresee his friends* reaction to his advice. 

They will call him a fox who has lost his'tale in a trap and 

* 

now would like to see them cut off theirs. The fable does 
not fit completely, assures Goethe, because his intentions are 
of the best. He wants only to warn his friends against 
falling into the same trap. The reader assumes that by the 
word t trap t , Goethe means the unhappiness and trouble brought

about by an excess of love and life. 

The tone of the poem is strongly didactic. It is 
noteworthy, however, that Goethe does not dwell for long 
on the young people’s short-comings but suggests a positive 
ideal at which they can aim. Combined with the moral advice 
is a good deal of humor. Goethe is fond of making fun of 
himself and minimizing his emotions. As he watches his 
friends enjoying themselves his eyes become moist, but not 
too moist: 

Halb scheel, halb weise sieht sein Biick 
Ein biszchen nasz auf euer.Glttck 
Und jaminert in Sentenzen.- 1 -) 

The theme can hardly be called anacreontic. In fact 
it is just the opposite because it decries all the excesses 
in which the Anacreontics delighted. Goethe pictures 
nature in the conventional manner. He advises his friends 
to shun meadow, brook and sunshine and all the associations 
of unchecked exuberance which they call to mind. It is 
conventional, too, that he wants the group to sing his songs. 

Zueignung is characteristic of the majority of the poems 
in the Neue Lieder . They are less frivolous in tone and 
more reflective in mood than the ’Annette Lieder’. Several

of them are didactic but the moral is not an anacreontic 
appeal for sensual pleasure but for a balance between 
intemperance and abstinence in all things. 


Neujahrslied . 


Goethe wrote the poem Neujahrslied for Anna Katharina 

Schdnkopf on December 30, 1768. He himself sets the tone 

of the poem when he says that he wrote it in a moment of 

foolishness: " Das Neujahrslied ....habe ieh in einem Anfall 

von groszer Narrheit geschrieben und zum Zeitvertreibe 

2) 

drucken lassen." 

In various poems of the 'Annette Lieder* Goethe assumes 
a variety of roles. In Ziblis and Lyde he appears as a 
story-teller and moralist, in Kunst, die Sprflden zu fangen 
and Pygmalion as a Don Juan, and in Annette an ihren 
Geliebten as a young lover. In this poem, in contrast, he

assumes the guise of a pedlar who is hawking his wares at the 

market on fair day. Since it is the beginning of the new 

year, he is selling resolutions which he claims, will fit 

everyone whether rich or poor, young or old: 

Wer kiJmmtJ Wer kauft von meiner Warl 
Devi sen auf das neue Jahr, 

Ftir alle St&nde. 1 2 ' 

In a loud voice he praises the properties of these ready¬ 
made resolutions. Even if it should happen that he can not 
offer advice to one particular individual, the rest of his 
resolutions will fill the needs of hundreds of people. Goethe 
accentuates the idea of the mass production of his resolutions 
by comparing them to a glove which will fit twenty hands: 

TJnd fehlt auch einer hie und da, 

Ein einz'ger Handsehuh paszt sich ja, 

An zwanzig HStnde. ' 

His first piece of advice is directed to young people 
in their teens who are experiencing love for the first time. 
They r ttadeln r and in their innocence, are satisfied with 
kisses. After a year's experience, however, they will 
become more astute and will demand more. 

The next resolution applies to young people who are 
already better acquainted with the ways of Amor (Amors

Wegen). Goethe expresses anxiety about the abandon with 
which they are carrying on their love affairs. Now is the 
time, he advises, to let themselves be ruled by reason before 
it is too late. 

The newly married couple are the next to receive his 
counsel. They should not let jealousy come between them 
for it brings with it nothing but pain and will make their 
marriage a burden. 

Fourthly, Goethe counsels the newly bereaved widower 
not to dream fondly of joining his wife in death. This is 
after all the faint-hearted approach to his problems. He 
can easily find what he is lacking and what will torment 
him, i.e. love, right here on earth, if only he will stop 
grieving and look for it. 

In the next stanza, which is probably the most humorous 

in the poem, Goethe addresses misogynists. Such woman-haters 

ought to let wine leighten their spirits. If in the process 

the wine should make their heads heavy, that is nothing 

compared to the 'headaches* of anShetropf lV (hen-pecked husband}. 

Zwar Wein beschweret oft den Kopf, 

Doch der tut manchem Ehetropf 
Wohl zehnmal weher. 1 2 '

The last stanza is, fittingly enough, Goethe's own 

resolution for the coming year. He asks Providence for 

many a merry song which may please others as well as himself. 

If the girls will join in singing with him, all his wishes 

will be fulfilled: 

Der Himmel geb' zur Frtthlingszeit 
Mir manehes Lied voll Munterkeit, 

Und euch gefall' es. 

Ihr lieben M&dchen singt sie mit, 

Dann ist mein Wunsch am letzten Schritt, 

Dann hab' ich alles. 1 2 ' 

The most obvious anacreontic feature in this poem is 

the reference to Amor in his role of the god of love. 

Conventional too, are the insinuations implied in the first 

and second pieces of advice which Goethe supplies. The 

2 ) 

line "before it is too late" has an especially ominous 
ring in its vagueness. The idea of having girls sing the 
poet's songs is also conventional. The poem as a whole is 
humorous and in places true to life, but is not to be taken 
seriously.

Per wahre Genusz * 

Per wall re Genus 2 had an interesting origin. Goethe 

was motivated to write the poem by some remarks which his 

friend Behrisch had made about his employer, Prince Leopold 

Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, whose licentiousness had won him 

a certain notoriety. At this time Behrisch was the tutor 

1 ) 

of the prince’s natural son. In this poem Goethe contrasts 

the prince’s dissolute love life with his own true love for 

his sweetheart. Since Goethe sent the finished poem to 

Behrisch in December 1767, we conclude that he is referring 

2 ) 

to KSthchen Schflnkopf. 

In the first version of the poem, Goethe addressed the 

prince with the apostrophe F®. When Behrisch objected to 

this form of address and suggested that he remove the phrase, 

3) 

Goethe refused, accusing Behrisch of "exaggerated delicacy.” 
Three months later he charged his mind and asked Behrisch to 
substitute the word "Freund” for "Fttrst" in his copy. 

Goethe’s criticism of the prince’s love affairs is 
highly constructive. In the first four stanzas and the last

stanza he gives him five pieces of advice. Firstly, the 
prince must abandon the idea that money will buy anything. 

It may buy the allegiance of the mob but this is just outer 
appearance; it will not buy a woman’s heart. Goethe maintains 
that one must offer sincere love if that is what one hopes to 
receive in return. Besides resisting venality in others, the 
prince must guard against sensuality in his own nature. 

Above all he must not forget his superiority as a human 
being. Sensuality can be expected from animals as it is part 
of their instinct but man, through his intellect, is able 
to visualize a higher relationship at which he must aim. 

Goethe makes this clear by saying that man must refine 
sensuality: 

.... verliere 

Den Yorzug eines Menschen niel 
Denn Wollust ftthlen alle Tiere, 

Der Mensch allein verfeinert sie.^' 

What is defined sensuality? It is passion which is controlled 

by reason and which recognizes certain barriers. 

Goethe’s third piece of advice has to do with these 
restrictions on passionate love. The reader is surprised to 
discover that in this poem Goethe does not uphold the 
tradition of free love as he did in the majority of the 
poems in the * Annette Lieder*. In Der wahre Genus z he

maintains that moral precepts are not stuffy vestiges of 
by-gone days but guide posts to the individual’s happiness. 
One should not feel exasperated by these laws because after 
all they do not hinder one’s enjoyment of life. In fact, 
they may save the individual many trying situations because 
they distinguish between love which is worthy and that which 
is not: 

Lasz dich die Lehren nicht verdrieszen, 

Sie hindern dich nicht am G-enusz, 

Sie lehren dich, wie man genieszen 
Und Wollust wtfrdig fiShlen musz.-*-' 

Fourthly G-oethe advises the prince to think seriously 
of restriction or retrenchment in matters of the heart. 

Only one woman should claim his affections. If her love is 
sincere, a bond of tenderness will unite them in place of 
a religious vow. This very lack of constraint will emphasize 
the depth of their love for each other and will draw them 
closer together. Lastly G-oethe reverts to the idea that 
passionate love is preferable to crude sensuality. The 
prince should not be satisfied by external beauty but 
should select a woman who is beautiful of body and soul, as 
is Goethe’s Annette. 

At this point the reader may ask: On what grounds does 
Goethe feel justified in delivering a moral lecture to

someone else, especially to a haughty prince? In Don Juan 
fashion he replies that he knows what he is talking about, 
since he has followed his own advice with the happiest of 
results: 

Ich, der ich diese Kunst verstehe, 

Ich habe mir ein Kind gewfihlt, 

Dasz uns zum Glttck der schtfnsten Ehe 
Allein des Prtesters Segen fehlt. ' 

Following this burst of self-conceit, the poem develops into 

a eulogy of Goethe’s relationship to KStthchen Schtfnkopf. 

Both love one another passionately and make each other 

completely happy* They do not require extravagent displays 

of affection but find pleasure in simple, everyday expressions 

of love* Mutual respect forms the basis of their union; 

passion is checkea by reason. Returning to his original 

theme, Goethe strongly suggests that the prince follow his 

example. If he does, Goethe guarantees that he will 

experience heaven on earth. 

tten this poem is compared to some of the shorter ones 
of the ’Annette Lieder’, the originality of its thought 
appears at once. The poem is centered around Goethe’s 
experience, although it is difficult to- say whether completely 
or only in part. Definitely unanacreontic are the ideas of 
restricting passion and refining basic drives into mutual

respect and affection. The frivolity associated with 
anacreontic poetry as a whole and which appears in many 
poems of the f Annette Lieder’, is lacking here. Sven the 
word "Wollust’’ which was so loved by the German Anacreontics 
takes on a new meaning in Goethe’s hands. If this word is 
translated as "voluptuousness" or "sensuality", the poem 
does not make sense. By using the word in the sense of 
passionate love, Goethe removes many of the derogatory 
connations associated with it. 

There are very few features in the poem which can be 

classed definitely as anacreontic. The first of these, 

the delight in descriptions of the female form, is 

reminiscent of the poems of Gleim and Uz. It is easy to 

imagine the sly twinkle in young Goethe’s eyes as he writes: 

Ich bin genttgsam und geniesze 

Schon da, wenn sie mir zSrtiieh lacht, 


Und mir, bei halbgeraubten Kttssen, 

Den sonst verdeckten Busen zeigt.^-' 

The second conventional feature is the triple reference to 

"Jtingling"* This feature may be regarded as paralleling the 

anacreontic custom of addressing the heroine of the poem 

directly. The motif of love which cannot be bought or 

^sold clearly reveals the influence of the poetry of the day.

Goethe, however, varies the idea slightly as he says: 

Gold kauft die Zunge ganzer Haufen, 

Kein einzig Herz erwirbt es dir; 

Doch willst du eine Tugend kaufen, 

So geh und gib dein Herz dafttr. ' 

These lines, particularly the last one, bring out the idea 

of mutual affection of a more lasting nature than the love 

which the Greek master and his imitators praised. 

The tone on the whole is too didactic to make reading 
enjoyable. The poem is, however, evidence of Goethe’s 
gradual swing from the anacreontic tradition to his own ideas 
expressed in his own way. Here he is using anacreontic 
motifs as a support for his own ideas. Although it is 
difficult to ascertain how far the advice which Goethe offers 
in this poem mirrors his own experience, the reader is able 
to understand Goethe’s personality better through this poem 
than any of the ones in the ’Annette Lieder’.

Die Nacht. 


The theme of this poem may be summarized as follows* 

The nature lover would gladly renounce the beauty and 
stillness of nature for one night with his beloved. At 
first glance this theme seems to be thoroughly anacreontic. 

But when compared to the poems of the Pseudoanacreontics and 
the German Anacreontics which deal with both nature and love, 
a basic difference is noticeable. In the anacreontic 
tradition all nature works together to introduce and sustain 
the mood of love and most love scenes are depicted against a 
natural background. In Die Nacht , however, nature and love 
are at odds. Nature stirs feelings within the young man which 
are entirely different from those created by memories of his 
sweetheart. Although the lover appreciates the multiplicity 
of emotions which the night arouses in him, this is not enough 
and even while experiencing them, he is yearning for his 
loved one. 

This feeling for nature merits closer inspection. The 
young man has just left his sweetheart f s house and is 
returning home through the deserted forest. Above him the 
moon breaks through the tree tops. The birches seem to 
bow their heads and the sweetest fragrances sift through 
the air. Suddenly a shudder pierces his innermost being

and a murmuring, which arises from the woods, fills his heart 

and stirs his soul. There can be no doubt that this is 

genuine appreciation of nature. In the first version which 

Goethe wrote of this poem, this mood mounts up into a tension 

which is not resolved and which awakes in the reader an ill- 

defined sense of fear: 

Schauer, der das Herze ftthien, 

Der die Seele schmelzen macht, 

Fltfstert durchs Gebttsch im Ktthlen. 

Welche schSne, stlsze Nacht! 1 2 ' 

In the revised version of this poem which Goethe included 

in his collected works under the title Die schdne Nacht , 

the fear and awesomeness of these lines has given way to 

joy. Nature is interpreted as friendly and peaceful and 

the overall mood is one of cheerfulness. 

Wie ergdtz* ich mich im Ktthlen 
Dieser schOnen Sommernacht! 

0 wie still ist hier zu ftttilen^ 

Was die Seele gliacklich macht. 

Although Goethe has introduced his own interpretation 
of nature into this poem, he still relies on conventional 
expression to a degree. Following the anacreontic custom 
he personifies the various aspects of nature with conventional 
names: 

Luna bricht die Nacht der Eichen,

Zephyrs melden ihren Lauf. 

His reference to incense in the following lines reminds the 

reader of Anacreon's description of myrrh and fragrant 

salves and the Pseudoanacreontics' delight in spikenard* 

Und die Birken streun mit Neigen 
Ihr den stlszten Weihrauch auf. ' 

All in all, Die Nacht is a genuine nature poem* The 
reader tends to overlook the anacreontic touches because 
they are not as well integrated into the thought as a 
whole as in some of his earlier poems. One motif which is 
decidedly original and which appears again and again in 
Goethe's later poems is that of 'der einsame Wanderer' 

(the lone wanderer) who strolls by himself out in the 
open air: 

Gern verlass' ich diese Htttte, 

Meiner Liebsten Aufenthalt, 

Wandle mit verhttlrtem Tritte, 3 x 
Burch den ausgestorbnen Wald. ' 

This passage gives the reader an insight into Goethe's 

position as a poet at the age of nineteen (1768). On one 

hand he wanted to explore nature and to find out what it 

meant for him, on the other he was caught up in the 

anacreontic tradition of treating nature as an insignificant

part of the pseudo-antique world. As he saw nature more and 
more for himself and not through the eyes of others, his 
expression became more and more individualized until finally 
he was creating new words and phrases to express sensations 
peculiar to himself alone. 


Das Schreien. Nach dem Italienischen. 


This poem is actually nothing but a reworking of Das 
Schreyen which appears as the fourteenth poem of the 
f Annette Lieder*. The contents have not been substantially 
altered. The poem still presents a tryst in true anacreontic 
style, but in this version it is held in a forest instead 
of in a grove. The other changes are chiefly of an 
orthographic nature. For "Schreyen", Goethe no?/ writes 
"Schreien**; for "trozzig", "trotzig"; for "stdhrt", "start"; 
for ft t8dten ft , n t8ten"; and for "Mfidgen", "Mfidchen". These 
revisions from old German to modern German seem to indicate 
Goethe's growing dissatisfaction with the anacreontic style 
as a vehicle for his own ideas. In this second version of

the poem he no longer attempts to recreate an earlier age 
by means of archaic spelling but presents the theme as it 
is for what it is worth. 


Schadenfreude. 


The lyric poets of Goethe T s day delighted in 

materializing the souls of people who had just died. One 

of the favorite shapes, which these * reincarnated f souls 

manifested, was that of a butterfly. Thus in this poem a 

young man who has been dead only a short while flutters 

bach to scenes of former happiness in the guise of a 

butterfly. Hovering over a pair of lovers, he relives the 

experiences of which death has robbed him and regains his 

carefree mood. The girl catches sight of the butterfly 

just as the young man's attentions have begun to frighten 

her. She jumps to her feet and suggests that he should 

try to catch the pretty creature: 

Liebster, komm, ihn einzufangeni 
KommJ ich h&tt* es gar zu gerne, 

Gern das kleine bunte Ding.l)

In this, way the girl is well rid of her amorous young man 
and experiences malicious joy (Schadenfreude) in foiling 
his hopes. 

The theme of the rendezvous is typically anacreontic. 

The young couple is also described in a conventional 

fashion. The girl has twined a wreath for her hair: 

Yon des schdnen Mttdchens Haupte 
Aus den Krfinzen schau' ich nieder. ' 

The love scene might well have been taken from one of Gleim's 

poems as far as phraseology is concerned. Conventional, too, 

is the reference to the gods who watch over lovers: 

Sie umarmt ihn l&chelnd stumm, 

Und sein Mund genieszt der Stunde, 

Die ihm gttt'ge Gutter senden. ' 

The tone of the poem is gracious and playful. Even 
after death the soul continues to play at the game of living. 
Now it assumes a shape which allows it to return to foimer 
haunts as though it had never passed from its body. The 
girl's actions are in keeping with this gracious tone. She 
trembles when the young man attemps to go too far, but does 
not raise any outcry or attempt to repulse him directly. 
Instead, she jumps up nimbly and suggests that the young 
man should direct his efforts to catching the butterfly

and leave her alone. The transition is accomplished smoothly 
without marring the delicacy ol* the poem. 

Nature is described conventionally. Again it is 

entirely subordinated to love. In fact, only those places 

which remind the butterfly of past conquests are mentioned. 

iSven these are described in general terms as if the author 

did not want to reveal any details which could be used as 

evidence against him: 

Wber Wiesen, an die Quellen, , 

Urn den Httgel, durch den Wald. ' 

The poem would be a perfect anacreontic piece except 
for the humor it contains. This does not mean that humor 
and conventional treatment cannot appear side by side. They 
frequently do in the poems of the German Anacreontics. But 
mo.re often than not, this is wit rather than humor and is 
brought about by manipulation of words or lines instead of 
descriptions of incongruous scenes. It is rarely that 
Gleim, for instance, creates an incident which is genuinely 
humorous when lifted out of the poem. In Schadenfreude , 
however, Goethe does just this. The scene in which the 
butterfly follows the movements of the lover f s lips is 
priceless:

Und sein Mund genieszt der Stunde, 

Httpft vom Busen zu dem Munde, 

Von dem Munde zu den Httnden-, 

Und ich httpf um ihn Herum. ' 

This passage and the unexpected turn at the conclusion, 

which saves the girl from the young man f s advances, are an 

excellent example of the extra touch Goethe adds to an 

anacreontic theme. Schadenfreude can be considered one of 

the high points of the anacreontic tradition. 


Das Glttck. An mein Mttdchen. 


In this poem Goethe stops for a few minutes to consider 
the ways of fortune and the transitory nature of happiness* 
He equates happiness with a dream which vanishes when the 
sleeper awakes to face the real world. Goethe made this 
comparison clearer by renaming the poem Glttck und Traum 
(Happiness and Dream) when he later published his collected 
works.

The reader assumes from the subtitle of the original 
that Goethe is addressing Anna Katharina Schtfnkopf. She 
has often dreamed that they both stood before the altar* 

She was the bride and Goethe the groom. Goethe, too, 
dreamed of their happiness and translated his dreams into 
action whenever he was alone with her. Looking back on 
the days of their greatest joy and their deepest passion, 
he realizes that such happiness lasts only as long as the 
situation: 

Das reinste Glilck, das wir empfunden, 

Die Wollust mancher reichen Stunden 
FIoh wie die Zeit mit dem Genusz. ' 

In a pessimistic tone he asks himself ho?/ this enjoyment 

has benefitted him. Now that he is no longer so happy, the 

memory of his former bliss torments him. If what is true 

of the past is true of the future, his outlook on life 

will be necessarily bleak, for all the joy which he will 

experience at some future date will be just as evanescent 

as his love for Annette. 

This poem illustrates one of Goethe’s favorite 
techniques. He devotes the first stanza to the situation 
and the second (which is also the last), to the conclusions 
which he draws. The keynote of the poem, the line "Was

hilft es mir, dasz ich geniesze?" reflects his relation to 
K&thchen SchOnkopf toward the end of his stay in Leipzig 
when the young people had decided to remain nothing more 
than good friends. From his reflections Goethe wins 
resignation. Both thought and language are unanacreontic. 
The poem stands at the opposite pole to such a conventional 
piece as, for instance, Annette an ihren Geliebten . The 
second version, written forty-six years later is much freer 
and more revealing. 


Wunsch eines jungen Mgdchens . 

In this poem the reader sees the world through the 
eyes of a young girl. Her one wish is to find a husband. 

Then life would be wonderful, or so she thinks, for she 
could forget about the drudgery of sewing and school 
work. As a married woman she would be in charge of a 
household of her own and would be her own mistress. Naturally, 
she would command a small army of servants who would perform

the manual labour. She would keep the chambermaids on their 

toes and abuse them to her heart r s content; 

Da kann man befehlen, 

Hat Mfigde, darf schmaien. 1 2 ) 

Since her word would be final in the selection of clothes, 

she would demand taste and style in every stitch which the 

tailor took. In the afternoon she would show off her finery 

by strolling down the street and in the evening by dancing 

at fashionable balls. For the first time in her life she 

would not have to ask ’Papa’ and ’Mama* for permission 

before going anywhere or doing anything: 

Und fragt nicht erst lange 
Papa und Mama. ' 

These lines sum up her naive wish. In marriage she is 
seeking freedom from parental restrictions, not realizing 
that she enjoys more freedom as a young schoolgirl than 
she ever will as wife and mother. 

There is nothing reflective or thought-provoking in 
this poem. It is just an expression of the fresh, naive 
feeling of a young girl. As such it is realistic, and 
from the girl’s point of view, extremely practical. She 
does not dream of a romantic lover who will worship her

every movement but for a well-to-do businessman whose wealth 

and prestige will make her life easier. Although this poem 

1 ) 

is one of the earliest of the collection , it contains 
no outstanding anacreontic features. Its brisk, saucy tone, 
combined with delicacy in form make the poem pleasant 
reading, but it is not to be taken seriously. The reader 
does, however, derive a certain satisfaction from contrasting 
his superior knowledge of life to the girl's naivety.

The epirhalamium, of which this poem is an example,

The opening stanza describes the bridal bedroom in a 

fashion which is almost oriental* The pure gold of the flames 

of the candles shimmers with a mystic and sacred glow* 

Eddying vapours of incense permeate the room: 

Es blinkt mit mystisch heil’gem Schimmer 
Vor ihm der Flammen blasses G-old, 

Ein Weihrauchswirbel fttllt das Zimmer, 

Darnit ihr recht genieszen sollt. 1 * 3 ' 

Amor is sitting in the bedroom, far from the sounds of merry¬ 
making. Like a faithful servant he is guarding the chamber 
in order to make sure that no serenading pranksters disturb 
its peace: 


Xm Schlafgemach, entfernt vom Feste, 
Sitzt Amor dir getreu und bebt, 

Dasz nicht die List mutwill’ger G&ste 
Des Brautbetts Frieden untergrgbt.2) 


As the clock strikes the hour at which the guests are 

to. depart, the bridegroom’s heart beats faster* His longing 

for his bride’s lips becomes a burning desire. As he hastens 

with her into the sanctuary (Heiligtum), the flame in Amor’s 

hand dims until it becomes a little flickering night light: 

Das Feuer in des WSchters H&nden 

Wird wie ein Eachtlicht still und klein.

young bride trembles before her husband’s caresses: 

Wie bebt vor deiner Ktsse Menge.. 

Ihr Busen und ihr voll GesichtJ 1 ' 

Her former severity gives way to gentle quivering. What 
would formerly have been rashness on the part of the young 
man, now becomes his right as it is sanctified by the 
Church. 

Again Amor appears to lend a hand. He helps the groom 
undress but in spite of his haste he is not half so fast 
as the young man. Since he is a discreet assistant and 
does not want to see what will follow, he holds his eyes 
shut, roguishly and modestly at the same time. He is 
content that he has contributed to the happiness of both 
the groom and his bride. 

Hochzeitlied is the first of Goethe’s poems whose subject 
matter is marriage and legitimate love. It is not surprising, 
however, that he treats it in anacreontic fashion. Such 
features as the description of incense which quickens the 
emotions and the fairy-tale setting appear in the poems of 
Gleim and Gdtz. Conventional also is the fact that the poem 
is narrated from the man’s point of view. Only once does 
Goethe address both newly-weds. The role of Amor is

significant for it would appear that he has here assumed 
the duties of Hymen, the Greek and Roman god of marriage. 

He preserves the stillness and solitude of the bridal 
chamber while the newly-weds are being toasted by the guests 
in the hall. Later, he makes the couple welcome and 
accommodatingly snuffs the candle he is carrying. In the 
first version of the poem, he was described as bearing a 
torch, a typically anacreontic touch. Here, as in other 
poems in the collection, his aim is to encourage passionate 
love. It is highly unusual, however, that he should be 
interested in love in marriage as this was generally 

i 

considered too serious for him. Even in this atmosphere 
of sanctity, Amor’s roguish nature reveals itself as he holds 
his eyes shut, grinning broadly, no doubt, all the while. 

Hochzeitlied contains several individual touches blended 
with the conventional features and has more body and a 
greater feeling of suspense than the average anacreontic 
poem. As a whole, however, the poem impresses the reader 
as being conventional. There is no doubt that Goethe has 
handled a dangerous theme skilfully. This poem and others 
in the collection which combine conventionality and originality 
make it clear that Goethe carried the anacreontic tradition 


to its climax

Kinderverstand. 


This poem consists of two double contrasts. The main 

theme is a contrast between the attitudes to love of young 

people in the city and those in the country. G-oethe further 

subdivides this theme by considering the contrast in attitudes 

between the boys and the girls in each area. The boys in 

the city mature quickly as far as knowledge of sex is 

concerned. In the midst of large numbers of people they 

read and hear more and often know more at twelve than their 

fathers did on their wedding days: 

IJnd mancher ist im zwdlften Jahr 
Fast kltlger, als sein Fater war, 

Da er die Mutter nahm. 1 ' 

The girl who grows up in the city wants only to be 

admired. With this end in view, she cultivates affected 

manners and dresses ostentatiously. Obsessed with her own 

appearance, she becomes its victim, for her pride and conceit 

drive away her natural instincts for love: 

Der Stolz verjagt die Triebe 
Der Wollust und der Liebe. 2 ' 

On the other hand, life in the country is much more

serious. At an early age the boys must think of earning a 
living in the fields. After working steadily for twelve or 
fourteen hours, they are too tired to pay much attention to 
the girls. Besides, they are rather stupid and do not know 
what they are missing. What they do know, does not intrigue 
them: 

Wer von der Arbeit mttde, 

LHsst gern den M Side hen Friede. 

Und wer noch obendrein nichts weisz, 

Der denkt an nichts, den macht nichts heisz; 

So geht r s den Bauern meist.^' 

Country girls, too, must work long hours to earn their 

bread, but their work does not exhaust them physically. It 

is only natural that they should think of the boys and 

dream of happiness in marriage. Nor are resourceful farm 

girls content to day-dream about marriage and wait for the 

farm hands to propose. Taking matters into their own hands, 

they often prod the young man into doing what they would 

never think of, if left to themselves: 

Oft stoszen sehdckernd Brgute 
Den Br8ut T gam in die Seite. 1 2 ' 

The poem consists entirely of reflections. Goethe 
relates facts, or rather observations. These observations 
have led him to conclude that city girls are vain, whereas

country girls are strong-willed, and that farm boys are too 
tired and ignorant to be able to match the city boys' experience. 
It would seem that the good and bad qualities of both city 
and country are fairly evenly balanced. Goethe doe s not state 
any moral or call for any changes as he does in Per wahre 
Genusz . The contrast, as he presents it, is full of humor 
and does not make too serious an impression on the reader. 

The foremost anacreontic feature of this poem is the 
contrast between city and country. Goethe has, however, 
not carried it out to its conventional conclusion by calling 
for a return to nature after the style of Rousseau, Gleim 
and Uz. 


Die Freuden. 


In this poem Goethe turns from such feelings as love 
and happiness to concrete objects. The first lines express 
his delight in the sight of a dragonfly. As the beautiful 

insect flutters around a spring, the rays of the sun are 
reflected in its wings and in the sparkling water. Its

translucent wings seem to glisten now red and blue, now blue 

and green. In fact, the colors change and blend so quicmly, 

that the dragonfly reminds Goethe of a chameleon: 

Bald dunkel und bald helie, 

Wie ein Chameleon; , * 

Bald rot und blau, bald blau und grtln. 1 2 ' 

The beauty of the shimmering tints draws Goethe like a magnet 

He will not be satisfied until he can hold the insect in his 

hands and examine it in detail. The little creature flits 

from stalk to stalk over the still meadows, unaware of the 

danger which threatens it. Great is the poet's elation when 

he catches it, but even greater is his disillusionment when 

he discovers that what shimmered in all the colors of the 

rainbow afar off is only a dull blue when close at hand: 

Da hab' ich ihn! 

Und nun betracht f ich ihn genau, 

Und sen* ein traurig dunkles Blau.2) 

Goethe realizes that this incident of the dragonfly is 
symbolic of many of the actions which cause us disappointment 
Ke admonishes therefore that one ought not examine in detail 
that which gives joy as a whole: 

So geht es dir, Zergliedrer deiner Freudeni 3 ^ 

There exists a danger in dissecting individual aspects

of one of nature*s marvels. The joy in beholding is often 
offset by the discovery that what is beautiful as a whole is 
not beautiful considered detail by detail* In other words, 
the sum of the whole is not made up of the sum of its 
individual parts. The very impression made by the whole is 
in itself an extra quality. The conclusion is without doubt 
based on Goethe T s personal experience. He is capable of 
observing nature in great detail and yet not losing sight of 
the whole. The narrator of the poem may well symbolize the 
naive impatience of youth. As soon as he finds something 
beautiful he wants to be active, to take it apart. He is 
not content to enjoy the overall effect, as contemplation 
comes only with age and experience. The same thought is 
expressed in the saying, distant fields look greener T and 
in the tales about windows which shine like gold. 

Although the poem is unmistakably didactic, its tone is 

light and graceful. Another version of the poem which has 

been handed down is more plastic and expresses greater 

1 ) 

action. Hie Freuden is not in the slightest anacreontic. 
It is one of Goethe's most delightful nature poems, as it 
is full of the appreciation of the little living things in 
nature.

Amors Grab* Nach dem Franzdsischen. 


In this four-line poem Goethe addresses a group of girls, 

bidding them weep at the side of Amor r s grave as he relates 

the sad fate of the little god. His death was caused by a 

mere nothing, an accident. Even though his body is lying 

in the grave, Goethe will not swear that he is really dead, 

for a mere nothing, an accident will often re-awaken him; 

Doch ist er wirklich tot? Ich schware nicht dafur* , 

Ein Nichts, ein UngefShr erweckt ihn afters wieder. ' 

This idea of a re-awakening led Goethe to retitle the poem 

Scheintod (Apparent Death) when he included it later in his 

2 ) 

collected works. 

If the reader accepts this poem at its face value, he 
will regard it as an example of conventional treatment of the 
love theme as personified by Amor. Through an accident, the 
little god has died, but he will rise up from the dead 
because the world cannot do without him, for it is he who 
makes the lives of young people, particularly of young girls, 
worth living. 

Another interpretation is possible. Amor may be regarded

as nothing but a symbol for love. Goethe, then, is comfort in 
girls who are unhappy because their love affairs have come to 
nothing. But, he assures them, a mere nothing, perhaps a 
word or a smile, is all that is necessary to awaken their 
love again. One is never really out of love for long. 

The conception of Amor, the idea of dying from love 
and the device of addressing the girls directly mark this 
poem as typically anacreontic. The theme is not original 
with Goethe, but is adapted from the French. 


Liebe und Tugend . 

In this poem Goethe inquires into the motives behind 
a young girl’s actions. Above all he is interested in the 
problem why some girls are virtuous and others are not. He 
sets up the hypothetical example of a girl who has been 
trained by her mother in the three-fold absolutes of virtue, 
chastity and duty. When such a girl deliberately disobeys 
her mother’s warnings and flees with increased desire into 
her lover’s arms, she is in all likelihood acting out of

sheer wilfullness and not out of love. A rebel at heart, 

she exploits love as a means with which to revenge herself 

on her mother: 

Da hat daran der Eigensinn 
So vielen Anteil als die Liebe.- 5 -' 

As a further example, Goethe puts forward the case of 

a girl who has apparently absorbed the mother’s teachings. 

How proud the mother is to see her daughter flee from the 

advances of young men. But says Goethe, (and the reader 

can almost see him shaking his head sadly), the happy 

mother is deceived. She obviously does not know a young 

person r s heart, for the girl who acts prim and proper is 

more likely to be fickle than virtuous: 

So kennt sie nicht das Herz der Jugend; 

Denn wenn das je ein M&dchen tut, 

So hat daran der Wankelmut 

Gewisz mehr Anteil als die Tugend. ' 

The theme of the "strenge Mutter" who tries to teach 
her daughter to be a paragon of virtue is conventional.. 

In Lyde , Goethe has already presented the theme of the 
capricious daughter who rebels against her mother’s moral 
lessons. The tone of hiebe und Tugend is probably more 
skeptical than any other poem of the Neue Lieder . Apparently

Goethe firmly believes that only a young person can interpret 
correctly the feelings and actions of someone the same age. 

This youthful know-it-all is satisfied that he has seen through 
the motives which often pass for love among girls. Nevertheless 
his observations are certainly much more penetrating than the 
platitudes which Gleim, for instance, put forward. 


Unbe stgndigkeit . 


Goethe devotes the first stanza of this poem to a 
detailed account of the situation, just as he does in Das 
Glttck . In the second stanza, however, he does more than 
draw conclusions. He presents a moral. 

The situation is as follows. As the swimmer stretches 

out his arms toward the approaching wave, the wave presses 

against his chest and strokes him amorously: 

Auf Kieseln im Bache da lieg* ich, wie helleJ 
Yerbreite die arme der kommenden Welle, 

Und buhlerisen drttekt sie die sehnende Brust.^-'

As the frivolous wave swells on past him, another takes its 
place which pleases him as much as the first: 

Dann ftthrt sie der Leichtsinn im Strome darnieder, ^ \ 

Es naht sich die zweite, sie streichelt mich wieder. ' 

Here is without doubt the most striking instance of the 
personification of nature in the Keue hieder . Not only is 
nature endowed with the form of a young girl, but also with 
her character traits. The wave is as frivolous as a girl 
is faithless. Just as the swimmer discovers how wanton one 
wave is and turns to the next, so the lover discovers how 
fickle one girl is and turns to another. Just as the 
second wave pleases him as much as the first, so the second 
girl is as much to his liking as her predecessor. 

In the second stanza G-oethe muses over the conclusions 
arising out of this comparison. How sad it is that men slur 
over the precious hours of life because their sweethearts 
have lost interest in them. The moral of the poem is: do 
not shed any tears over a faithless girl, but look for another, 
for she will be event hdb 3 lovable than the first: 

Es kttszt sich so sttsze der Busen der Zweiten. 

Als kaum sich der Busen der Ersten gektJszt.^J 

The attitude to love embodied in this poem is conventional.

It is worth noting that a later version is more reserved, 
the word "’Busen” having been replaced by "Lippen". Although 
the second stanza is strongly didactic, the mood of the poem 
as a whole is light-hearted and carefree. The comparison 
of the frivolity of the wave with the fickleness of a young 
girl is a new twist to a threadbare theme. From now on 
nature symbolism plays an increasingly prominent role in 
Goethe r s lyric productions. The reader notices that especially 
water often symbolizes human character traits. This poem 
reminds us of one of Goethe f s most beautiful poems, Gesang 
der Geister tttber den Wassern , in which he compares the 
human soul to flowing water. In conclusion, Uribe st and igne it 
can be classified as anacreontic in theme but ’goethisch* 
in imagery. 


An die Jnschuld . 

Goethe dedicates this poem to innocence. Innocence, he 
maintains, is the most beautiful of all character traits 

for it is the source of tenderness:

Reinster Quell der ZSrtlichkeit. 

Innocence is an ideal which should be praised and exalted 
when it is evidenced, because it is attained but seldom. 

Even though exceedingly rare, it is not a vague, hazy state 
of being, but the foundation of true and lasting love. 
Innocence is worth much more, Goethe maintains, then the 
virtue which Richardson*s heroine Harriet Byron vaunts in 
the novel Sir Charles Grandison . Innocence is in the same 
category as altruism; the truly innocent person does not 
expect any material gain from his behavior as does the 
puritanically virtuous Pamela in ramela or Virtue Rewarded . 

Goethe compares innocence to a small clear light which 

burns steadily even though a larger, more brilliant flame 

(I.e. passion) eclip-ses its glow every now and then: 

Wenn ein andres Feuer brennet, 

Flieht dein zSrtlicht schwaches Licht.-'' 

Going further, Goethe personifies innocence as a goddess 

whose being is in some way'bound up with nature. She appears 

only to the poet early in the morning, before the sun shines. 

He can best compare her to a fine, delicate mist which clings 

to the meadows in the early hours. But as soon as Phoebus, 

the sun, appears in his magnificence, the mist shyly vanishes

PhQbus kommt, der Nebel fliehet, 

Und im Nebel bist du hin.l) 

The mood of the poera is one of serene reflection. The 
poet has retired from the hustle and bustle around him to 
contemplate one of the eternal truths. To give his thoughts 
expression, he turns to nature-symbolic images rather than 
to anacreontic words. Even the word ”Phtfbus 7T loses much 
of its conventional connotation in the midst of Goethe’s 
wonderfully clear imagery. An die Unschuld is an example of 
Goethe’s growing skill in the symbolic interpretation of 
nature. The theme as a whole is definitely unanacreontic. 

It not only negates passionate love and in its place exalts 
innocence, but also embodies a genuine understanding of 
nature. All in ail the poem can be said to be f echt goethisch’.

fourth man, who is not named. The reader has to rely on the 
title to give him a clue as to this person’s identity. Like 
the hero of Moliere’s .^e Misanthrope (1666), the fourth man 
hates mankind. Of a listless nature, he is content to sit 
and dream rather than taking an active part in life. 

Apparently he has withdrawn from society only recently, for 
as B’s remarks indicate, he can still he moved by memories 
of relations with people. 

The first speaker, A, describes his two chief expressions. 

The first denotes relaxation and satisfaction. His 

1 ) 

countenance is sunny (die Stirn von Wolken frei) and he 

seems to be sfc peace with the world. Suddenly every line in 

his face assumes a serious cast. Speaker A humorously 

compares this expression to that of an owl, the philospher 

among the birds: 

Auf einmal kdmmt in Eile 
Sein ganz Gesicht der Eule 
Yerzerrtem Ernste bei. ' 

Speaker B, looking at the misanthrope’s face, wonders what 
feeling has brought about the sudden transformation. He 
suggests that it was caused by either love or boredom. 

Speaker G, asserts knowingly that both love and boredom 
have caused it.

170 


Ach, sie sind's alle zwei. 

The poem is somewhat abstract. The reader must fill 
in the missing details if he wants to catch its mood. The 
transition from cheerfulness to seriousness is skilfully 
recorded. No explanation for the misanthrope's scowl is 
really offered if one rejects the alternatives, love or 
boredom, which speaker B puts forward. Goethe has succeeded 
in catching the feeling of disappointment which everyone 
experiences when reminded of an unhappy event. This is 
however not necessarily the memory of an unfortunate love 
affair. If it were, the reader would expect the poem to 
be entitled f Der Weiberfeind* (The Misogynist) or something 
similar which would definitely suggest a disappointing love 
affair. 

The poem does not contain any outstanding anacreontic 
characteristics.

Die Reliquie . 


This poem refers to the practice of exchanging love 
tokens which was as popular in the eighteenth century as 
it is today* The form which these pledges take has changed 
but not the sentiment behind them. In the first stanza 
Goethe, addressing a young man, says that he can appreciate 
his joy in receiving as a pledge a ribbon, veil-,, neckerchief, 
garter or ring which belonged to his beloved. But his 
sweetheart, Goethe boasts, has given him something so valuable 
that it puts all this tf Tr8delware" (rubbish) to shame. She 
has given him a lock of her beautiful hair: 

Sie schenkte mir die sch8nsten Haare,,\ 

Den Schmuck des schdnsten Angesichts. 1 

All other pledges are but lifeless objects but her hair 
was only shortly before a living, growing part of her. The 
lock gives him a second happiness because it symbolizes her 
love for him and reminds him of the blissful times they 
spent together. He experiences his first and greatest 
happiness, naturally, in his sweetheart’s presence. The 
pledge is a consolation when she is not there for he can 
always see and touch it:

Soil ich dich gleich, Geliebte, missen, 

Wirst du mir doch nicht ganz entrissen: 

Zu sehn, zu tandeln und zu Ktlssen, 

Bleibt mir der schBnste Teil von dir. 1 2 3 ) 

Goethe realizes that his fate and the fate of the lock are 

curiously entwined. Formerly they both shared the young 

girl f s happiness, both were near her, both caressed her; 

now they are both far from her. as Goethe addresses the 

curl directly, it taxes on an independent existence. In the 

last stanza Goethe personifies it as a fellow-suitor for 

his sweetheart T s love. But it is not a competitor in the 

true sense of the word because it is free from all envy. 

It wants only to recall past happiness to Goethe f s mind. 

The reader surmises from later poems that Goethe gave 

pledges just as enthusiastically as he received them. One 

of the.most beautiful poems of his Sesenheim period, Mlt 

elnem gemalten Band describes a hair ribbon which he painted 

2 ) 

and gave to Friederike Brion. As a further example, in 

a poem to Frau von Stein he speaks of sending a bouquet tied 

3 ) 

with a blue ribbon. 

The idea of sending love tokens is by no means 
restricted to anacreontic writing, nor is it especially

anacreontic in this poem. The word choice exhibits few 

conventional features except for the verbs "buhlen", "tsndeln", 

and "kttssen", and the following lines: 

Fest waren wir an sie gehangen, 

Wir streichelten die runden Wangen 
Und gleiteten oft mit Verlangen 
Yon da herab zur rundern Brust. ) 

In this passage practically every word stresses the sense of 

touch - "streichelten", "runden” and "gleiteten"* The total 

effect is a sensuous word picture of the female form 

according to the conventional pattern* Another anacreontic 

touch is the way in which Goethe singles out the person 

addressed, for example, "0 Jangling", "Geliebte", and 

"0 Nebenbuhler". 


Die Liebe wider Wilien* 


As the title indicates, in this poem Goethe laments 
the fact that, even though he Knows better, he has fallen 
in love. He scoffs at the idea of love by claiming that

girls are completely fickle. In fact lie compares their 

conception of love to the way they play cards: 

Ihr liebet, wie im Kartenspiel, 

Den David und den Alexander. 

The reader can interpret these lines to mean: In card games 
the girls love the kings; in real life they like the men 
who have most to offer. Or the passage may imply that girls 
love now one man, now another, just as they like first one 
card and then another. No matter how one interprets it, 
it is clear that Goethe has discovered that there is no way 
to outmanoeuvre the girls for they have all joined forces 
to worn together in matters of the heart. 

Even though he knows all this, moans Goethe, he is just 

as miserable as before. He is love r s slave, a pitiable 

fool with the expression of a misanthrope. How he would like 

to be rid of love’s pain* Experience has taught him, however, 

that scorn will never drive love and its pain away for it 

is too deep-seated: 

Allein es sitzt zu tief im Herzen, 

Und Spott vertreibt die Liebe nicht. 1 2 ' 

This poem presents the often portrayed situation of the 
unhappy lover who turns on love and, in his misery, mocks

everything connected with it. His destructive assault 
emphasizes the illogical nature of love but does not make 
him feel any happier. The last lines contain a note of 
resignation. If he cannot be rid of love, he decides, he 
might just as well try to accept it good-naturedly. 

The idea of the power of love which can hold the lover 
against his will is anacreontic. Yet few anacreontic poets 
describe a girl's fickleness so cynically. Anacreontic 
poets customarily delighted in love T s pain and lived it over 
and over again in their writing instead of wishing themselves 
free of it as does Goethe here. The tone leads the reader 
to believe that Goethe is presenting his own experiences 
and that he has individualized the conventional idea of the 
irrational power of love.

Goethe is no longer passionately in love with K&thchen. 
Apparently he is far from his Leipzig sweetheart as the later 
title, Glttck der Hntfernung , makes clear. Nevertheless 
neither jealousy nor longing torment him. On the contrary, 
although he does not stop thinking about her, he discovers 
that he can concentrate on the matter at hand. Time and 
distance, he says, have soothed his inflamed blood. As 
his heart becomes lighter, his happiness grows more intense. 

He realizes that si person's joy increases instead of 
decreases when he is separated from his beloved. This 
thought is the keynote of the whole poem: 

Doch das Gltick bleibt immer grdszer, 

Fern von der Geliebten sein. ) 

The idea that 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' 
is completely alien to the Goethe of the 'Annette Lieder' 
in which he reveals himself as an impetuous and often 
unreasoning lover. He is young, conceited and a bit of a 
show-off. In the 'Annette Lieder' his aim seems to be to 
tell an interesting story or to make a parade of worldly 
wisdom rather than to express what he thinks and how he feels. 
Now', however, he pauses to analyze his feelings right at 
the moment and to present them for what they are worth.

The young man he addresses in the first line might well 

be an image of himself as the passionate lover of the early 

part of his stay in Leipzig. He too drank 

.heil'ges. Glttcke , 

Taglang aus der Liebsten Blicke 1 2 ' 

and at night his sweetheart’s picture also rocked him to sleep. 

This detached description of a lover’s bliss is a far cry 

from some of the passionate phrases he used in the ’Annette 

Lieder’. 

He describes how the "eternal forces", time and distance, 

working secretly like the "power of the stars", calmed his 

spirit. Perhaps it was in nature, perhaps in the contemplation 

of the heavens that he became aware of his true position. At 

any rate he now realizes that his infatuation must be 

imperceptible to others if he wants the love in his heart 

to grow into reverence and the desire into ecstasy: 

Und unmerkliche Bet Q rung 
Macht die Liebe zur Yerehrung, 

Die Begier zur SchwSrmerei. 

As his passion cools, his love becomes more intense. His 
feeling's become more and more tender while his happiness 
increases by leaps and bounds. Although they are apart, he 
cannot forget his sweetheart. He thinks of her in a

cheerful and yet unruffled frame of mind. As he puts it, his 

love does not upset his digestion: 

Nirgends kann ich sie vergessen. 

Und doch kann ich ruhig essen. 1 ^ 

In this newly won peace his love reaches its peak. He 

knows neither fear nor envy; nothing disturbs his serenity. 

He has won a balance between love and life. Here, as is 

frequently the case when he wants to express the climax of 

his thought, he creates a figure of speech based on nature. 

His heart experiences greater joy than the gentlest cloud 

which has been drawn up by the sun into ethereal bliss: 

Aufgezogen durch die Sonne 
Schwimmt im Hauch &ther f scher Wonne 
So das leichtste WBlkchen nie, , 

Wie mein Herz in Huh und Freude. 2 ' 

This passage is an example of one of the most delicate and 

most sensitive images from the realm of nature to be found 

in the Neue hieder . Although he refers to "Sonne", "Herz", 

"Wonne" and "Freude", these words have absolutely no 

conventional connotation here. In this poem Goethe does not 

see nature through an anacreontic veil. He sees the natural 

world as living and striving just as human beings. The 

cloud, too, can experience bliss in achieving its greatest 

ambition, union with the sun.

The mood of this poem is cheerful and stands in sharp 
contrast to the feeling of resignation in Das Glflck . It is 
quite unusual that Goethe should describe only his present 
condition. Not a single line is devoted to a description 
of earlier joys which he and Kfithchen shared together. 

The only anacreontic feature of the poem is the 

1 ) 

exhortation ,f o Jttngling”. Every other word in the poem 
is Goethe’s own and is permeated with his own feeling. 

Both thought and expression (particularly the image of the 
cloud) are original. Das Glttck der Liebe is unquestionably 
one of the high points of the Neue Lie der . 


An den Mond. 


The theme of this poem is strongly anacreontic. Goethe, 
looking up at the moon, wishes he could travel beside it 
through the sky and look down on his beloved. The first 
stanza is devoted to an invocation to the moon and a description

of its functions. Ai e calls it "Schwester von dem ersten 

1 ) 

Licht". The same idea is expressed in Bernis 1 Poesies , 

which Goethe knew and in which the moon is called "la soeur 

2 ) 

aimable du soleil". Addressing the moon as f thou f , he calls 

her a vision of tenderness in mourning, for streaks of silver 

mist float across her charming face: 

Schwester von dem ersten Licht, 

Bild der Zttrtlichkeit in Trauerl 
Nebel schwimmt mit Silberschauer 
Um dein reizendes Gesicht. 3 ^ 

The moon is not only a lovely widow but a widow who walks 

across the sky and whose footsteps rustle in the night* Goethe 

says that her gentle footfall wakes the souls of the departed 

from their dens which are sealed by day, as well as the 

nocturnal birds and himself: 

Deines leisen Buszes Lauf 
Weekt aus tagverschlosznen Htfhlen 
Traurig abgeschiedne Seelen, 

Mich und nMcht 1 ge V9ge1 auf• 4 ' 


After this invocation, Goethe begs the moon to raise him 
to her side. He would be in ecstasy as, looming down from on 
high, he would catch a glimpse of his sweetheart through the 
lattice window of her bedroom. The last stanza of the 
original version creates a land of dusky half-shadows. This

The sight of the sleeping girl is too much for the young 
lover: 


181 


Trunken sinkt mein Blick hernie 
Was verhflllt man wohl dem Monet? 



At this point Goethe resumes the personification of the moon 
which he had discontinued for one stanza. The moon is 
credited with human desires. In spite of the fact that 
nothing is hidden from her sight, her desires are frustrated 
for she has to continue to "hang up there" in the sky* No 
wonder she is squinting herself blind, chuckles Goethe. 

The last stanza of the second version bears a stronger

resemblance to the older Goethe 1 * s style 


pure joy of observing the forbidden sight more than 
counterbalances the inconveniences caused by the distance.

beloved. He feels himself drawn to her as the moon was 
once to EndymionJ

According to legend, Sndymion was the most beautiful of men 
and was loved by Selene (the moon). By her contrivance or 

at his own request he was thrown into a perpetual sleep and

the moon descended every night to embrace him. Both 
this reference to mythological times and the invocation add 
an anacreontic touch to the poem which is maintained in the 
later version of the title An Luna . 

The whole 'peeping Tom* motif is conventional, as has 

been shown in the discussion of Triumph der Tugend, Zwote 

Erzghlung . In An den Mond , however, the young man is 

content with wishes. Conventional^ to o> is the emphasis on

the female form (die unverhttllten Glieder). The earlier 
version of the last stanza is far richer in sensous images 
than the second. Goethe lingers, for instance, on such 
expressions as "Wollust", "runde Glieder", "trunken", 
"Begierde" and "genieszen”. 

Goethe's conception of the moon is anacreontic only 
in part. The emphasis on "Silberschauer" and "ZSrtlichkeit" 
is conventional but the complex personification is not. 

'Echt goethisch' are the lines which describe the manner 
in which the dead rise from their graves under the influence 
of the moonlight. Goethe's conception of himself in this

poem reminds us of the motif of the 'lonely wanderer' which 
appears in Die Dacht . In this poem he is alone under the 
open sky at night. In Die Nacht the stress is laid on the 
appreciation of nature; in this poem it is on the anacreontic 

theme. In this connection Goethe calls himself "der 

1 ) 

weitverschlagne Ritter". 

The polished style of ah den iiond strikes the reader 
at once. Its short balanced lines mark a decided improvement 
over the long, rather ungainly verse structure of the poems 
Triumph der Tugend and Hunst, die Sprflden zu fangen of the 
'Annette Lieder'. In this poem the reader finds evidence 
of Goethe's growing skill and boldness in creating new words. 
He is particularly fond of compounding an adjective from a 
past participle and a noun or adjective, as for example, 
"tagversch^oszne H8hlen", "groszgemeszne Weite" and 
"weitversehlagner Ritter", or from a noun and adjective, as 
for instance "wollustvolle Huh". These forms are completely 
Goethe's own. They are fused with so much artistry that 
they can not be rendered in a more striking manner. More 
and more the reader is becoming aware that Goethe is winning 
his struggle for a style of his own.

Am Flusse. 


This little poem, which so fittingly concludes the 
Neue Lieder , is one of the most beautiful and most melancholy 
in the collection. In it Goethe commits his songs to the 
sea of forgetfulness. These songs which glorified his 
sweetheart mean nothing to him now that she has scorned his 
fidelity. In fact he does not want them to be sung anymore. 

From these few facts the reader can reconstruct the 
situation. Goethe and KSthehen Sch^nkopf have parted. 

KSthchen has turned to another suitor. Goethe, depressed and 
disillusioned, addresses his verses as they appear before 
him in his mind's eye. Now that E&thchen loves another, they 
no longer seem to serve any purpose. He can think only of 
his present misfortune which he sums up in the thought that 
whatever happiness we possess sooner or later flows away 
like water. Somehow it seems fitting that the poems, which 
he asserts in Zueignung were composed beside the water, should 
flow away with it: 

Ihr wart ins Wasser eingeschrieben; 

So flieszt denn auch mit ihm davon!-**) 

Goethe again draws on the storehouse of nature for an

image to parallel and represent his own feelings. It is 

probably the transitory quality of his love which brings to 

mind a river which is always flowing and changing. Expanding 

the image, Goethe makes the river symbolize unfaithfulness 

just as he did in Unbestandigkeit . Now, however, his mood 

has completely changed and water is here associated with 

melancholy. Although Goethe is only speaking figuratively 

when he ’commits his creations to the water’, his words 

are rich in concrete detail: 

Verflieszet, vielgeliebte Liefer, 

Zum Me ere der VergangenheitA' 

The idea of destroying something which recalls an unhappy 
love is not new. Goethe’s presentation of this theme is, 
however, original. By means of nature symbolism he 
individualizes it so much that it seems to apply to him 
alone. The only anacreontic feature in the poem is the 
motif of friendship. Here, as in Zueignung he sees in 
imagination a group of boys and girls gathering around to 
sing his songs. 

The tone of the whole poem is one of resignation* But even 
though Goethe is discouraged he will not do anything desperate 
because he has overcome his chagrin by writing this poem. Am 
Elusse clearly possesses the properties of a confession.

CONCLUSION 


. 

■ 








187 


Now let us draw the conclusions of our investigation, 
first of the ’Annette Lieder’ then of the Neue Lieder . From 
the preceding analysis we can state conclusively that the 
anacreontic element in Goethe’s ’Annette Lieder’ is pronounced* 
By systematizing our investigations we shall now try to 
determine how far reaching this anacreontic influence is and 
to what extent the ’Annette Lieder’ are evidence of Goethe’s 
own originality. 

Probably the strongest direct influence of the 
anacreontic style appears in Goethe’ s choice of subject 
matter. His theme is always love in some form. Every poem 
in the collection, with possibly the exception of Ode an 
nerrn Professor Zachariae , rightly deserves to be called a 
love poem. Goethe presents every situation in an amatory 
light, even scenes of mourning in Elegie , which is ostensibly 
a dirge. To be sure, in most instances this is not love in 
the sense of affection, but sensual gratification. But it is 
possible for a poet to take over a these and reproduce it 
any number of times, and yet not be completely in agreement 
with the ideas which it contains. This is the case with 
Goethe. In some of his poems he seems to champion the 
anacreontic philosophy of life. In these poems both his 
thought and his treatment of the motifs are conventional.

But at other times he uses the anacreontic theme and its 
motifs only as a foundation, adding here and subtracting 
there. It is by examining his attitude to life and more 
especially to love, as well as the motifs through which 
he presents his ideas, that we will be able to distinguish 
the anacreontic from the "Goetheschen". 

Let us review the conventional attitude to life and 
love. For Anacreon life and love were almost synonymous. 

Life was meant to be enjoyed and the only way to enjoy it 
to the full was to devote oneself to the pursuit of love. 

One should be an uninhibited lover, ready to dare anything 
for the joys of the night. Desire colored the lover's thinking 
to such an extent that his will became its slave. Love was 
a blind, all-powerful force which swept reason aside and gave 
its victims no rest. The German Anacreontics introduced 
the idea that love, by which they meant passionate love, was 
a game. No matter how Intensely a man might love at a given 
instant, he could transfer his affections at will. It took 
a cunning and experienced Don Juan to master the tricks of 
the game and to hoodwink the girl f s parents, the girls, 
however, quickly became as adept as their lovers. They met 
advances with coquetry. The key-note of this attitude to 
love is the 1 insincerity and transiency of feelings which 
supposedly come from the heart.

In such poems as Ziblis and Annette an ihren Geliebten , 
Goethe appears as a dyed in the wool Anacreontic. As far as 

he is concerned love is nothing but a jolly game. Any trick 

is fair and the winner 1 s reward is sensual enjoyment. It is 

by no means out of the goodness of his heart that Emiren 

assists Ziblis. In typical anacreontic fashion he has his 
reward firmly in mind before challenging the Waldgott. Amor 
can and often does join in the fun. In Kunst, die SprOden 
zu fangen (II) , the lovers parry insincere declarations of 
love. They are part of the game too and constitute a 
’playing with feeling’ rather than real emotion. The lovers 
do not look forward to lasting affection. In An den Schlaf , 
for instance, they want to see no farther than the immediate 
fulfilment of their desire. In Pygmalion , Goethe implies 
that the worst outcome such a union could have would be 
marriage and advocates the carefree life of a Don Juan. 

This attitude to love is almost an echo of that expressed 
in the poems of Gleim and U-z. 

Goethe’s attitude to love seems to have altered slightly 
in Lyde . The beginning is conventional. Both the lovers are 
filled with desire. Passion reigns. But for once the young 
man is honest enough to confess that too much sensuality 
sickens him. He wants to be loved for himself, not because 
he is a member of the male sex. Falling in love is not so

instantaneous, he decides, at least not if one wants something 
more permanent than sensual enjoyment. But he is too hot- 
blooded to forego romance completely and seek a quieter hobby. 
He determines that in future he shall have love by all means, 
but in moderation. This theme of moderation certainly 
contrasts with the idea of 'love and leave r , endorsed by 
the German Anacreontics. It is reminiscent of one of 
Anacreon's verses, in which the poet advocates moderation in 
both drinking and love-making. Although it at first appears 
paradoxical, this idea of temperance is decidedly 
unanacreontic even though Anacreon himself advocated it. 

Later interpreters succeeded in suppressing this idea so 
thoroughly that when Goethe puts it into words it must be 
termed unconventional. Although the subject matter, passionate 
love, is anacreontic, the idea of moderation is 'goethisch' 
and gives us an insight into the personality of the rapidly 
maturing poet. 

So far, Goethe's attitude to love appears to be twofold. 
Most of the poems have centered around sensual love and at 
least one important one has stressed temperance in love. 

Three poems, however, do not fit into this pattern. Elegie 
deals with love in courtship. It is the "heilige Liebe” 
of a friendship which has ripened into a bond of tenderness. 
Strictly speaking, it is not platonic, because it does seek

fulfilment, but only In marriage. This thought is completely 
foreign to the anacreontic tradition which ridicules marriage 
as a prudish convention. In Triumph der Tugend (I) , Goethe 
rejects sensuality, calling it a product of opportunity 
which is unworthy of the noble-minded individual. Self- 
control is the theme of Triumph der Tugend (II) in which 
Goethe dethrones the conventional free love in favor of 
virtue. Putting forward a convincing case, he argues that 
virtue is not an outdated concept but a sound principle, for 
it brings the reward of a clear conscience. Granted this 
idea is unconventional, we cannot call the three poems 
mentioned original because their vocabulary, images and 
secondary motifs are quite conventionalized. 

Goethe, then, submits not one, but three different 
approaches to the conventional theme of love. He is not 
content to sing the praises of sensuality but tries to paint 
a picture of life which is at any rate closer to everyday 
experience. We could set up a pat theory if we asserted 
that these three different interpretations represent three 
stages in Goethe f s development from a love struck youth to 
a serious poet. We cannot set up such a theory, however, 
for the simple reason that we cannot be sure of the

three interpretations are, nevertheless, evidence of Goethe’s 
versatility and his inquiring mind. The final product is 
a stereotyped theme treated in an unconventional manner, let 
us look for traces of original thinking in Goethe’s handling 
of the other favorite anacreontic motifs. 

The "wachsame Mutter" motif was introduced and cultivated 
by the German Anacreontics, who laid great stress on its 
connotation of forbidden love. In this motif the girl’s 
mother played only the role of interrupter of anacreontic 
bliss and only the lovers’ point of view was presented. 

Goethe follows this technique faithfully in An den Gchlaf , 
in which the lover begs sleep to incapacitate the girl’s 
mother. But in Annette an ihren Geliebten and Lyde both 
parents stand guard over their daughter’s virtue. Goethe 
introduces new life into the motif by examining the 
mother’s viewpoint• In Ziblis she is not her daughter’s 
jailer but her adviser. Dipping into her store of experience, 
she tries to chart a straight course for her daughter. Her 
advice produces a variety of effects. As in Kunst, di e 
Sprflden zu fangen (I) it can harden the girl’s heart, making 
her gullible to the most obvious of lovers’ tricks. Or the 
girl can rebel against the moral platitudes and, as in Lyde , 

seize every opportunity to disobey her mother* s instructions. 
Or the seeds may fall on fertile ground, as in Triumph der

Tugend (II) . Here the mother’s ’’treue Lehren" give the girl 
strength to resist her seducer. The women in the ’Annette 
Lieder T seem to be made of stronger fibre than the men. 

The conventional rT wachsame Mutter” motif is scarcely 
recognizable in this new garb. Goethe is more interested in 
the -way in which the mother’s teachings affect the daughter’s 
personality than in the mother herself. We may see traces of 
the perversion of her advice in the girls’ prudery and 
coquetry. What passes for modesty, Goethe tells us, is 
really often false modesty, as is the case when Lyde averts 
her eyes, affecting embarrassment at the mention of another 
man’s name. Or it can be a trick of coquetry as, for example, 
when Charlotte in Kunst, die Sprflden zu fangen (II) , does 
the same thing. These analyses show that Goethe is aware 
of the world around him and of the quirks of human nature. 

He observes, reflects, and comments through them. Although 
presented in the same playful style as the majority of the 
poems, they demand intellectual activity on the part of the 
reader. This is contrary to all rules of anacreontic poetry, 
which aims at amusing the reader, not at making him think. 

Goethe does not hesitate to borrow the anacreontic 
motif of the dream. The German Anacreontics favored a 
situation in which the young man dreams of his lady-love in 
an inviting pose. Upon awakening and discovering that it

was only a dream, lie would turn over and try to carry on from 
where he left off. In Goethe f s hands the dream has a practical 
value. Instead of revelling in voluptuous fantasies, the 
dreamer jumps up and puts his dream into action. In Die 
Liebhaber the young man wins his sweetheart by means of a 
dream and fulfils his love when he awakes. A dream can also 
spur the lover on to do what he would never have dared do 
in real life. In Madrigal , for instance, the dreamer boldly 
declares his love even though he feels certain his suit 
will be rejected. This is a further example of the way in 
which Goethe redecorates a trite motif. 

So far we have been dealing in terms of fundamentally 
anacreontic motifs which Goethe has interpreted with varying 
degrees of originality. Are there no thoughts in the poems 
which can be described as f echt goethisch 1 ? The answer is 
yes. In Triumph der Tugend (II) , Goethe introduces a feature 
which is completely incompatible with the anacreontic 
philosophy. The heroine appeals to God to shock her 
seducer back to reality. This appeal to the Supreme Being 
is so intense that it practically negates everything Goethe 
has said in praise of Yenus, Amor, and the other classical 
gods and goddesses. This religious note elevates the tone 
of the poem and is decidedly unconventional. Goethe T s 
denunciation of absolutist tyranny is also very moving.

He argues that a ruler’s selfishness is inexcusable because 
each of his subjects suffers on account of it. The last 
poem in the collection impresses upon us the sincerity of 
Goethe’s unhappiness at leaving Annette and his friends in 
Leipzig. The thought is simple and there is no sophistry 
or cynicism. Perhaps that is why it appeals to the reader 
so much. 

The motif which best lends itself to anacreontic 
treatment is nature. As far as Anacreon was concerned all 
nature could cease to exist except for leafy arbors and 
clusters of grapes. He described it in as few words as 
possible so that he might devote his time to the really 
important thing, the enjoyment of life. The German 
Anacreontics made a ritual out of nature description. From 
the myriad natural wonders they selected only those which 
helped to build up the atmosphere of a moonlight tryst. 

The season was generally spring, the time was midnight. 
Overhead the moon peeped into the grove and round about, 
laurel bushes ensured privacy. Following their example, 
Goethe does not see nature as the source of life and growth. 
In the ’Annette Lieaer’ nature as such would not hold his 
attention if it were not for its connection with the theme 
of love. Following the Anacreontics’ example, he 
manipulates groves, foliage, streams and myrtle bushes

at will to set up a cozy love nest. Goethe, too, favors 
the springtime, when the life processes are quickened, and 
midnight, when emotion prevails. In every poem which 
contains a natural setting, it is introduced within the 
first two stanzas and not referred to again. Only in 
Ziblis does he mention nature twice. 

Goethe is not yet conscious of movement and variety 
in nature. The groves and lindens he mentions might well 
be made of colored cardboard. Their only function is to 
provide a background for love-making. Nor is there any 
bond between nature and the individual. Only in later 
poems does Goethe suggest a parallel between nature and 
human feelings. In the * Annette Lieder f he superimposes 
the anacreontic conception of antique life on nature. No 
one is surprised to see a Waldgott spring out of an oak, 
nor does a Greek temple seem out of place. The reader 
enters a world peopled by gods and goddesses, nymphs and 
fauns, where the poet is inspired by the Muses and sings 
his songs to the accompaniment of a lyre. Shepherds and 
shepherdesses abound even though tending sheep is the 
farthest thought from their minds. This approach to 
nature reveals little of Goethe*s personality. It is just 
a restatement of what Gleim, Uz and Gdtz have already said.

Goethe pays homage to the supreme ruler, little Amor, 

as did Anacreon and Gleim and assigns the conventional 

traits to him. Although a god, he is really just a 

capricious little boy at heart. In nunst, die Sprttden zu 

fangen (II) he will not be bribed or coerced into doing 

anything which runs counter to his present mood. It is wise 

to appease him, Pygmalion discovers, for he punishes 

offenders with a marriage yoke. Goethe reintroduces the 

idea that Mor’s presence is necessary to ensure the 

fulfilment of love. No eulogy in his honor is inappropriate 

or extravagant. In his Ode an Herrn professor Zachariae 

Goethe maxes an excursion of four lines in length to praise 

Amor, who is S? unser gtit’ger Better, der Venus vielgeliebter 

1 ) 

Sohn n . By and large Goethe’s presentation of Amor follows 
the basic anacreontic pattern, complete with bow and arrows. 
In iiunst, die Sprdden zu fangen (II) , he departs from the 
tradition long enough to make fun of the god’s curiosity 
and vanity. Here he reduces the mighty ruler of men to a 
clammy, meddlesome insect. 

All the other motifs which Goethe presents are 
thoroughly anacreontic. He is fond of the motif of the 
pursuit, as are Anacreon and Hagedorn. In Triumph der

the young man, not the girl, is the loser. 

We generally associate the idea of ’Sichbescheiden’ with 
the works of the German Anacreontics. They were not 
reformers. They favored the status quo as long as they could 
hold their drinking parties and make love to women. By and

’Annette Lieder’ would coincide with this, with the exception 
of the drinking rounds. Position and wealth mean nothing to 
him, compared to his sweetheart’s favor* At least that is 
the thesis which he puts forward in Madrigal * 

Young Goethe was not a true anacreontic poet, if we 
consider the proper anacreontic subject matter to be ’wine, 
women and song’ for he sings the praises of the fair sex 
exclusively. -He is not a wine poet. Nowhere in his 
collection does he imitate Anacreon and Gleim in eulogizing 
Bacchus* Only in Nunst, die Sprflden zu fan^en (II) does 
he mention wine and drinking. Even here he does not 
rejoice in the joys of the vine but calculates on its 
intoxicating power to weaken his sweetheart’s resistance. 
Goethe is more interested in describing vines laden with 
luscious grapes than he is in presenting drinking scenes. 

Goethe does not stress friendship among men to the 
extent that Anacreon, Gleim or Uz do* According to these 
poets there is no merrier way to while away the hours than 
in the company of jolly fellows. A friend can be relied 
upon anywhere, anytime. We do not find this idea in the 
’Annette Lieder’. In fact both Pygmalion and Amin owe the 
sad outcome of their respective love affairs to a friend’s 
intervention. In Pygmalion the friend is good-hearted but 
misguided, and in Lyde he proves to k a seducer. In Kunst ,

die Sprflden zu fangen (II) , the young man makes a mockery of 
friendship* He undermines the wise mother 1 s teachings with 
pleasant words, affirming his honorable intentions all the 
while* Ode an Herrn Professor Zachariae could have been 
handled as a panegyric on friendship among men, but Goethe 
never drops the teacher-pupil distinction. He rejects also 
the conventional "Freundschafts n cults which elevated 
fraternal friendships above sexual love. In An A netten 
he says that he had thought of dedicating his poems to a 
friend but had changed his mind in favor of his sweetheart. 
Similarly in Slegie he has little interest in Bejarisch* 
reaction to his brother T s death but he elaborates on the 
bereaved woman’s grief at great length. 

What about Goethe’s style? Is it, like his subject 
matter, anacreontic? Or is it, like his treatment of this 
subject matter, moderately original? Let us examine the 
question of Goethe’s conception of himself first. About 
two thirds of anacreontic poetry from Anacreon to Gleim is 
written in the first person. Some of the poems of this 
type conclude on a moral note; others present a certain 
philosophy of life, Don Juanism, without tagging on a moral. 
In the ’Annette Lieder’ Goethe favors the first person in 

the ratio of eleven to seven. In three poems he steps in 
with a moral comment, whose tone is so insincere that we

suspect Goethe is having fun at our expense. Goethe applies 
another anacreontic device which is used especially by 
Hagedorn and Glenn. He steps in as narrator to report 
someone else's story. He takes pains to stress the story's 
authenticity and his own good faith in retelling it. Only 
in two poems can we say that Goethe is peaking for himself 
from beginning to end. In Blegie he expresses his own hatred 
of tyranny even though this expression is buried under 
conventional trappings. His sorrow at leaving Leipzig, as 
voiced in An meineLieder is unaffected. In a few poems, 
such as x rhumph der Augend (II) , conventional ideas and 
unconventional treatment are intermingled. By and large, 
however, we must label Goethe f s conception of himself 
anacreontic because the feelings he expresses do not seem 
to come from the heart. 

Anacreontic poetry is noted for its grace and sensual 
imagery, and not for its profundity. Anacreon, for instance, 
made no pretense about the superficiality of his thoughts. 
Most of Goethe r s poems in this collection would fall into 
this category. Some of his observations on human nature, 
however, bear a startling resemblance to real life. These 
comments make us reflect, even if only for a moment. The 
best of these are in epigrammatic form, such as "Schreyn

kann niemals ttberwinden". Stylistically speaking, Goethe r s 
poems contain more body than the poems of the German 
Anacreontics. His poems tell a story, whereas Gleim T s, for 
example, are often only a repetition of phrases, like a 
jingle. 

Anacreon was able to fuse humor and delicacy successfully. 
Gleim often sacrificed genuine humor for a polished phrase. 

His ”derber Witz” often bordered on the indecent. Goethe, 
too, delights in insinuation, in Lyde , Annette an ihren 
Geliebten and an den Sohlaf he challenges the reader to 
imagine whatever he pleases. Not ail of his humor is 
suggestive, however. Probably the most comical incident 
in the whole collection is the sham battle between Emiren 
and the Waldgott. 

The basis of most of the comparisons used by Anacreon, 
Gleim and Uz, is Greek or Roman mythology. Goethe does not 
hesitate to compare a lover to one of Diana T s huntsmen. 

Many of his other figures, as for example his comparison of 
Amor to- a bee, have appeared before in the poems of Uz or 
Gleim. Just as conventional is the practice of disguising 
the lovers 1 names. Anacreon rarely mentioned a female name.

Scorning Germanic names, Gleim fell back on the names of 
nymphs and of fauns. Goethe has fallen partly under this 
spell. He speaks of Emiren, Amin and DamiJt. But on five 
occasions he addresses Annette by name and at other times 
refers directly to "mein M&dgen". 

The tone of anacreontic writing is playful and 
insincere. It ranges from simplicity in Anacreon f s lyrics 
to sophistication in Gleim f s. The general tone of Goethe f s 
poems is brashness. He has not polished every word. Some of 
his moral comments are satirical and in Kunst, die Sprffden 
zu Tangen (I) he toys with cynicism. The tone is sincere 
from beginning to end in only two poems - Elegie and An 
Annetten . 

The only feature which remains to be considered is the 
word stock. Anacreon used a very limited vocabulary. The 
same thoughts and words appear again and again. He 
utilizes mainly concrete nouns and verbs which stimulate the 
senses. The German Anacreontics carried on the tradition. 
When Gl-eim, for instance, speaks of flowers, he resorts to 
such stereotyped varieties as roses and lilies. Goethe, too, 
seizes upon such threadbare words as tf Liebe n , "Woliust n , 
tt Kusz*and ft Wange”. Even whole phrases keep recurring, as 
for example, "ein feuriger Blick" and T, die weisze Brust tt .

No matter how original Goethe’s thought, it would never 
reach the reader by means of these stereotypes. The older 
orthography which he employs is in keeping with the 
anacreontic attempt to reproduce the bygone days. 


We cannot register the degree of anacreontic influence 
in Goethe’s ’Annette Lieder’ in absolute terms. If we were 
to content ourselves with three degrees of influence, slight, 
moderate and strong, we could summarize the results of this 
investigation as follows: 

1. Goethe’s subject matter considered as a whole is 
strongly anacreontic but his interpretation of it 
is moderately original. 

2. Of the major motifs which Goethe treats, the 
following are basically anacreontic: 

The ”wachsame Mutter”, the chase, friendship, 
nature, ’’Sichbescheiden”, the pastoral, love as a 
game, passionate love, the ruse, Don Juanism, the 
female form, ’peeping Tom’, coquetry, and the 
dream. 

3. Goethe treats the following anacreontic themes in 
the conventional manner: 

The chase, nature, ’’Sichbescheiden”, the pastoral, 
love as a game, passionate love, Don Juanism, 

’peeping Tom’, and the female form. 

4. Goethe’s treatment of these motifs, although 
anacreontic in themselves, shows moderate originality 
Love as temperance, the ’’wachsame Mutter”, the dream, 
Freundschaft, Amor the god of love, the ruse, and 
coquetry. 

5. The following themes are original: 

Love as virtue, attack on tyranny, appeal to God 
and sorrow at parting.

6. Goethe’s dual role of narrator and moralist is 
strongly anacreontic* 


7. Goethe is a love poet, not a wine poet. 


8. Goethe draws heavily on the anacreontic word supply 
and classical references. 


9. The feeling Goethe expresses does not strike the 
reader as being genuine. 


10. The ’Annette Lieder’ are interesting as a step in 
the development of Goethe’s genius. Although they 
show strong traces of anacreontic influence, 
original touches scattered throughout make them 
far superior to the verses of the German Anacreontics 
Gleim, Uz and GiJtz. 


Let us now classify the results of our investigation of 
the '!■ eue Lieder . from our analysis of the Neue nieder we can 
state that Goethe relies less and less on the anacreontic 
tradition. Instead of reworking conventional motifs he 
expresses his own ideas. Both subject matter and treatment 
of the majority of these poems is original. The anacreontic 
features which still remain are vestigial or else have been 
individualized. His style, too, reveals a growing skill 
and confidence in his ability. Let us first summarize his 
attitude to love in the Neue Lieder. 


Free love finds little favour in the >:eue Lieder .

Passion is given free reign only in Lie be und Tug end and even

elaborate pursuits and the descriptions of the joys of forbidden 
love. Love is still a powerful force which can dominate a 
man's thoughts 'whether he wills it or not, as in Liebe wider 
Willen , but it is no longer so intemperate. Goethe seems 
gradually to realize that he can master his feelings instead 
of letting them master him. 

The love poems of the Neue Lieder are less stereotyped 
than their predecessors in that they present the lover in 
a wide range of moods. In Unbestandigueit the young man 
can no longer treat love sincerely as a result of his 
disappointing love affairs. In Die Reliquie , on the other 
hand, the young lover's heart overflows with joy when he 
touches the Iock of hair which his true love has given him. 

In Das Glttck der Liebe , love means for Goer he an inner 
satisfaction which is so much a part of him, that it 
actually increases when he is separated from his sweetheart. 

Love can also awaken mixed emotions. Thus the misanthrope's 
face alternately lights up and grows troubled when he recalls 
love's joys and sorrows. Out of the experiences in love a 
mood of resignation often develops as in Das Glttck and hm 
Flusse . 

In the Neue Lieder Goethe's attitude to love is original 

and is based to a large extent on his own experience. The 
tone of resignation which runs through several of the poems 













207 


gives the reader the impression that Goethe is expressing 

his own ideas rather than dipping into the anacreontic 

treasure trove and pulling them forth ready made. Zueignung 

with its strongly didactic quality, has a particularly 

individual flavour. Although he veils his words here, 

Goethe seems to imply that he had to learn the hard way that 

true hap'piness consists in moderation. This idea is 

diametrically opposed to what might well he the anacreontic 

slogan ’enjoy yourself to the utmost while you can’. In Das 

Glttck Goethe realizes that one cannot hold on to happiness 

like a concrete object because it fades from memory like a 

dream. He seems sincerely depressed as he utters the phrase 

which re-echoes throughout the collection: "Was hilft es mir, 

1 ) 

dasz ich geniesze?" 

The chief objection raised against anacreontic poetry 
is that, the poets are ’playing with emotion’. This objection 
is valid only in regard to the poems nmors Grab , Das 
Schreien, and Schadenfreude . Sven here Goethe has so 
thoroughly caught the spirit of delicacy that Schadenfreude 
may be considered one of the high points of the anacreontic 
tradition. 

In the Neue Lieder Goethe turns to few anacreontic

motifs. He relegates Amor, who is a powerful god in the 
T -Annette Lieder’, to a minor oosition. In Amors Grab , for 
instance, Goethe recounts the circumstances of the god T s 
death and in Neu.jahrslied he acknowledges him to be the 
teacher of young lovers, Goethe seems to have lost interest 
in portraying the god’s capriciousness and regards him now 
merely as a symbol for love. No longer do his magic potions 
inflame girls’ hearts or his arrows awake desire in a man T s 
heart. He plays his most important role in Hochzeitlied , 
where he guards the bridal chamber, lights the way for the 
newly-weds and assists in the undressing. Even here he seems 
rather out of place for the love he symbolizes does not 
often end in marriage. 

Such typically anacreontic motifs as the "strenge Mutter" 
the headstrong daughter and prudery appear only in Liebe un d 
Tugend. The favorite T peeping Tom T motif occurs only in An 
den Mond , Even though Goethe treats love as a game in 
UnbestSndigkeit and moralizes ’do not mourn a faithless 
sweetheart’, he illustrates this idea so skilfully by the 
symbol of the wave that it is difficult to recognize the 
conventional motif. Another version of the love theme, the 
idea that love cannot be bought or sold, is stressed in 
Per wahre Genusz and calls to mind the verses of Anacreon. 

The reader notices that Goethe draws very little on classical

mythology for subject matter or names in the I eue Lieder . 

The majority of the favorite conventional motifs including 
the "wachsame Mutter", the ruse, the chase, fraternal 
friendship, the joy of wine, love and roses, dancing and 
the Moll 1 motif are lacxing entirely* 

G-oethe r s attitude to nature has been slowly maturing 
and it is probably in this field that we are now most aware 
of his latent possibilities. In the T Annette Lieder* 

Goethe sets up a world of nature which bears scarcely any 
relation to reality. In true anacreontic manner he 
manipulates'groves, forests and streams as a director would 
scenery on the stage and introduces gods, nymphs and 
shepherds to people this fanciful world. In the Neue lieder , 
however, only Zueignung and Schadenfreude embody this 
conventional interpretation.of nature. Die ffreuden , An die 
Unschuld , Die Nacht , Unbest andigke it and Das Glttck der Lie be 
are all genuine nature poems. There is no doubt that the 
feeling for nature expressed in these poems is original. 

Die Freuden maxes the reader realize Goethe's love of even 
the tiniest details of nature and his accuracy in recording 
them. In An den Mond Goethe departs from the anacreontic 
tradition completely by personifying nature. Probably the 
most beautiful of his nature poems is Die Nacht . So great 
is Goethe*s artistry that the reader involuntarily associates 
























210 

himself with the lover who is returning alone from his 
sweetheart f s house. The reader, too, must experience the 
stillness and eeriness of the forest at night. 

Already in this youthful collection, Goethe reveals 
himself as a master in the use of nature symbolism. This 
technique is completely alien to the works of the Anacreontics. 
Goethe f s comparisons are not only beautiful but so exact that 
they are striking. His comparison of the wanton wave to a 
fickle girl is brilliant. In some instances he even enriches 
nature by imparting human characteristics to it. The cloud 
in Das Glttck der Liebe , for example, yearns to unite with the 
sun. In this poem Goethe seems to have captured the airiness 
of the little cloud which, even in its bliss is not so serene 
as the poet's heart. His images also make many concepts 
clearer to the reader. Our understanding of innocence, for 
example, is broadened after reading his comparison of it to 
a mist in An die Unsohuld . 

The reader notices that, as Goethe f s poems become more 
original, his themes show greater variety and greater 
subtleties of feeling. Now practically every poem has a 
distinctive tone. Wunsch eines jungen Made hens is saucy, 

Die ffreuaen is graceful and iCinderverstand is factual.

poems, this mood develops into cynicism only in Liebe und 
Tu&end . 

In the Neue Lieder the insinuations of the ’Annette 
Lieder’ have developed into genuine humor. Only in 
Neujahrslied does G-oethe revert to oblique hints. His 
humor which peeps out now and then often adds an extra 
touch to one of the few themes which is still predominantly 
anacreontic. -The twist at the conclusion of Schadenfreude 
in which the lover’s plans receive a setback, and the humorous 
portrayal of Amor in Hochzeitlied as a faithful “but roguish 
servant help set these poems in a class above those of the 
G-eiman Anacreontics. 

G-oethe takes great delight in poking fun at himself in 
the Neue Lieder . In Die Nacht , for instance, he includes 
himself in the same category of wanderers as the nocturnal 
birds. He likes particularly to disparage his own ability. 

In Zueignung , for example, he refers to his writing as 
"Jammern" (moaning). At other times he combines humor 
with astute observations of human nature. In Wunsch eines 
,j ungen M&dchens he succeeds in catching a naive, young girl 
in the act of spinning fancies about a fairy prince in the 
form of a husband who will take her away from household 
chores forever. Similarly in Ainderverstand he characterizes

recognizable types in deft stroxes without forgetting to 
add a comical line or two. 

Just as his subject matter, so Goethe f s &yle is 
becoming increasingly original. He has abandoned the mixture 
of prose and verse he utilized to some extent in the *Annette 
Lieder T . He is now using short, quickly moving lines and, 
on the whole, his poems are more condensed. He is fond of 
developing his theme from the particular to the general. In 
Das Glttck , for example, he presents first the situation, 
then the conclusions he draws from it. Similarly in Die 
Freuden he examines the dragonfly and then expands his 
conclusions into a moral: do not dissect that which gives 
joy as a whole. 

The reader notices that his vocabulary, too, is losing 
most of its conventional features. Only in Schadenfreude , 

Das Scareien and Amors Grab do typically anacreontic words 
and associations appear throughout. Goethe relies on only a 
few conventional cliches in Die Reliquie , and in such poems 
as Das'Glttck der Lie be and An die Unschuld even these lose 
all anacreontic connotation. It is interesting to note that 
in Der wanre Genusz he speaks again and again of "Wollust" 
and means by it nothing more than passionate love. Goethe's 
words are becoming as individual as his ideas. Other authors

are satisfied with the standard word selection; Goethe, 
however, does not hesitate to create vivid, concise words when 
the existing vocabulary is inadequate to express his ideas* 
Most of these new words are compounds of exceptional beauty 
such as "Silberschauer” and "tagverschloszen”. They offer 
proof of the young poet r s increasing technical skill. 


following the pattern used for the 'Annette Lieder' we 
can systematize our findings concerning the heue Lieder as 


follows: 


1. In contrast to the 'Annette Lieder' Goethe's 

subject matter, considered as a whole is individual, 
as is his treatment of it. 


2. Goethe again treats the following anacreontic motifs, 
which he presented in the 'Annette Lieder': 
the "strenge Mutter”, the prudish girl, the 
headstrong daughter, 'peeping Tom', love which cannot 
be bought or sold, singing songs, addressing the 
person by name, Amor the god of love and the female 
form* 


3. The following poems are high points of the anacreontic 
tradition: 

Hochzeitlied , Amors Grab , Schadenfreude , and Das 
Schreien. 


4. The following poems^although anacreontic in subject 
matter, are treated originally: 

Unbesttodigkeit , Am fflusse , Liebe wider Allen and 
Liebe und fugend . 


5. The following themes are original and introduced for 
the first time:

"der einsame Wanderer", the use of nature symbolism, 
the appeal to the prince, 'absence makes the heart 
grow fonder 1 , the transiency of happiness, innocence, 
New Year's resolutions, love of nature, 'do not 
examine in detail what gives pleasure as a whole 1 
and love in marriage. 

The following poems are original in subject matter 
and treatment: 

Der wahre Genusz , hinderverstand , Der Misanthrop , 

Das Glttck der Liebe , An die Unschuld , Neujahrslied , 
Die Nacht , Das Gltick , Die Hreuden , Die heliquie 
and Zueignung . 


6. Goethe r s conception of himself as narrator and 
moralist is no longer anacreontic. 


7. Besides being a love poet, Goethe now reveals 
himself more and more as a nature poet. 


8. Goethe draws less and less on the anacreontic word 
supply and classical references. 


9. The reader gradually realizes that the feeling Goethe 
expresses is genuine, and that it comes from his own 
experience. 


10. The Neue Lieder are worth reading for their own sake 
in contrast to the 'Annette Lieder 1 . They are on 
the whole original in tbought and expression and are 
built on Goethe's own experience. 


Goethe's early poetry forms both the climax and conclusion 
of anacreontic writing. He carried the tradition to its peak 
in several beautiful poems. Yet even here his original humor 
makes these poems surpass anything which the German 
Anacreontics ever turned out. It was not long, however, before

Goethe discovered that conventional phraseology was stifling 
his genius. He turned instead to nature, which he now often 
regards as a reflection of what goes on in man’s soul and, 
in wonderfully clear imagery he draws a parallel between 
human characteristics and natural processes. Both the 
power of his expression and the depth of his thought give 
evidence of his gradual maturation. 

Even though imperfections exist in the nineteen year 
old 1 s Annette ^leder and Neue hieder , we can already 
recognize in them the genius into which Goethe was later 
to develop. At the same time, at least the Neue Lieder 
reveal another characteristic feature of Goethe 1 s creative 
ability: they are based primarily on personal experience 
and express what the young poet thought and felt. Thus 

i 

Goethe could justly assert in later years that ail his works 

1 ) 

were nothing but "Bruckstttcke einer groszen Konfession".
