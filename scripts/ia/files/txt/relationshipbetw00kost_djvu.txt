CHAPTER ONE 


INTRODUCTION 

1. HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM 

Bernreuter's Personality Inventory, as a means of measur¬ 
ing personality, is only one of many instruments that have been 
developed in recent years in the field of personality studies. 

It is, however, the best known and most widely used today, and 
has features that make it particulary well-adapted to situations 
where it is desired that certain personality abnormalities Ube 
detected for guidance or psychiatric treatment. As a group test 
it may be administered to many persons at one time, and it has 
the further advantage over many similar tests in. that it canvasses 
several different aspects of personality at once. In this way 
effecting considerable saving both in cost and in the time re¬ 
quired for administration. 

The Personality blank itself contains 128 questions which may 
be answered: Yes, No, ? It may be scored on each of six scales. 
Four of them (the B scales), prepared by Bernreuter and designated 
by symbols Bl-N, B2-S, B3-I, and B4-D, may be described as follows: 

Bl-N, A measure of neurotic tendencies. 

B2-S. A measure of self-stifficiency. 

B3-I. A measure of extroversion-introversion. 

B4-D. A measure of dominance-submission.

Separate scoring keys are used in scoring the inventory 
blank., one- for each trait tested. In the preparation of these 
keys the diagnostic value of each response to each question 
was determined for each of the traits. Weights from +7 to -7 
were assigned in accordance with these diagnostic values. The 
total score for a trait is the algebraic sum of the weights 
which correspond to the responses made by the subject, as given 
on the key, for that particular trait. 

The addition of the two F scales, Fl-C and F2-S, came about 
in the development of the Inventory. Bemreuter found that 
neurotic tendency and introversion-extroversion correlated about 
.95, so that they were virtually the same. Thus only three of 
the original four B scales were needed. Flanagan, by means of 
factor analysis, drew the conclusion that two traits, which he 
named self-confidence and sociality, were the chief components 
of the first four. These have been built into the scoring keys, 

Fl-C and F2-S, and can be used in place of the other four. Thus 
the inventory blank may be scored on the two F scales only, or on all 
six, depending on the preference of the administrator. 

Several features of the Bemreuter and Flanagan scales 
give rise to serious disadvantages in the use of the inventories. 

In the first place, the scoring of the six scales is a tedious 
affair. Except when the Veedor Counter, or the I.B.Machine, 
is used, hand scoring the six scales requires about thirty

minutes for each blank. Second, since the F scales appear 
to give equally reliable information as the individual scores 
on the four B scales, it seems of dubious worth to use the 
B scales at all. Finally, Bernreuter himself admits that n the 
inter-correlations between Bl-N, B3-I, and Fl-C scales are 
very high. Little is gained through using more than one of 
these three scales”. 

These features of the B and F scales prompted numerous 
attempts at revision and simplification of the original Bern¬ 
reuter method of scoring. The one with which this disserta¬ 
tion is concerned was put forward by Geo. K. Bennett. 


2. BENNETT REVISION 

Bennett describes his method of revision and simplification 
as follows: 

”It is apparent that if the blank could be scored for 
only the two Flanagan scales, the weights of these 
scores reduced to small positive numbers, and the loca¬ 
tion of percentile equivalents simplified, much time would 
be saved in scoring. Accordingly, the following steps 
were taken: 

1. A tabulation was made of the range of weights 
assigned to each item in the two F scales. 

Equivalent small positive weights were assigned 
accoriing to the original total weights.”

Bennett then prepared scoring keys for each of the two 
Flanagan scales by means of which raw scores could be obtained 
on the basis of the new weights assigned to each item in the 
blank. Since the new weights ranged from 0 to +2, the scoring 
by the Bennett method effected a tremendous saving of time. 

He further found that the coefficients of correlation 
between the raw scores obtained by the original method of 
scoring and by this revised and simplified method were .971 
for Fl-C and .938 for F2-S. These high correlations seemed to 
justify the use of the simplified method of scoring the two 
Flanagan scales. 

Furthermore, since the F scales could be used to estimate 
the scores on the four B scales, Bennett compared the scores 
obtained on the four B scales by means of the Bernreuter keys 
with scores estimated by means of the simplified keys, and 
found the following correlations: 

Bl-N — .95 B3-X — .951 

B2-S — .934 B4-D — .889 

To make the raw scores obtained on the four B scales 
more meaningful, Bernreuter converted them to percentiles. 
Similarly, Bennett obtained percentile equivalents for scores 
obtained by his simplified method. He then obtained two sets 
of percentile equivalents for a group of adult women whose 
blanks were scored by the Bernreuter keys and by the simpli-

fied keys. Comparing the two sets of percentiles thus 
obtained, he found the following correlations: 

Bl-N -- .951 B3-I — .934 

B2-S -- .883 B4-D — .924 


Bennett summarizes his findings as follows: 

"Since the multiple correlation is less than unity, 
there is some loss of accuracy by this method ..... 
In view of the fact that the traits which we are 
attempting to measure are subject to large quotidian 
fluctuations, at least as measured by the original 
scales, it is believed that the economy of scoring 
more than justifies the small loss in precision."

CHAPTER TWO 


THE PROBLEM 

1. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION 

It is demonstrably true that the Bennett siirplified system 
of scoring the Bernreuter Personality Inventory blanks effects 
considerable economies of time and effort. If it can be con¬ 
firmed that this system also yields substantially the same re¬ 
sults as the original Bernreuter method, then there would 
appear to be ample justification for the use of the simplified 
in place of the original qgstem of scoring the Bernreuter 
Inventory blanks. 

It has already been pointed out that Bennett submitted 
data to prove that correlation between the results obtained 
by the two methods is sufficiently high to warrant the use of 
his simplified system in the interests of economy. However, 
he based his contention on statistics he obtained from research 
which he carried out on relatively small samples drawn from 
populations found in American cities. For example, to obtain 
the coefficients of correlation between the original and 
simplified Flanagan scales, he used lip Personality Inventory 
blanks. To obtain the statistics for his chart of Bernreuter 
Percentile Equivalents for the Bennett simplified scoring 
system, he used the blanks scored by 100 adult women. 

Those who use the Bernreuter Personality Inventories in 
Canada feel a re el for some evidence that the use of the Bennett 
simplified scoring system is justified on the same grounds as

those claimed by Bennett. This dissertation and investigation, 
therefore, has a two-fold aim: 

1. to determine statistically to what extent the 
Bennett system of scoring the Bernreuter Inventory 
blanks yields substantially the same results as 
those obtained by the original Bernreuter method, 
when the blanks are administered to groups selected 
in Canada. 

2. to compare the results obtained in this investiga¬ 
tion with those claimed by Bennett. 

2. MATERIAL OF INVESTIGATION 


Both Bennett and Bernreuter computed separate percentile 
norms for the three main groups for which the inventory blanks 
were primarily devised, and for both sexes of each group; viz., 
college men and women, adult men and women, and high school 
boys and girls. 

This investigation concerns itself with the first two 
groups only; and the material which furnished the basic data 
therefor/was made up of one hundred and ninety blanks com¬ 
pleted by: 

1. forty adult men 

2. fifty adult women 

3. fifty college men

CHAPTER THREE 


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 


The first step in the investigation consisted of scoring 
the inventories by the Bernreuter method. Because each blank 
yields raw scores for each of the four B scales — Bl-N, B2-S, 
B3-I, and Bl±-D, it had to be scored four times. This consumed 
a great deal of time, and required over one hundred hours for 
the entire one hundred and ninety blanks. 

The second step consisted of transmuting, by means of the 
Tentative Percentile Norms, the raw scores to percentile 
equivalents. This was done for each of the four B scales for 
the one hundred and ninety inventories. This part of the pro¬ 
cess consumed another fifty hours. 

In the third step, the same hundred and ninety blanks were 
scored, on the F scales, by the Bennett Simplified Scoring 
system. For these F scales, Bernreuter percentile equivalents 
were read off from the Bennett Percentile Equivalent chart, 
and entered on each blank below the percentiles obtained from 
the Bernreuter Tentative Norms chart. By contrast, this step 
required less than 25 hours. 

The final step was the running off of coefficients of 
correlation between the two sets of percentiles obtained for 
each personality trait measured and for each sub-group of the 
sample. These coefficients of correlation are shown in 
Table II.

CHAPTER POUR 


DATA OBTAINED 

In calculating the coefficient of correlation between the 
percentiles obtained by the two methods, viz., the original 
Bemreuter and the Bennett Simplified systems, the product- 
moment method was used. This method of calculation was decided 
upon for two reasons. In the first place it lends itself to 
ease of computation in that the data can be grouped and pre¬ 
sented in tabular form, and the coefficient of correlation, r, 
calculated by the short method. In the second place, the 
sample is sufficiently large to warrant the use of this method. 
In calculating r between the scores on the four B scales made 
by the four sub-groups, 760 raw scores were compared.

As a check on the calculation of the coefficient of 
correlation by the Product-Moment method, the r’s, obtained 
for the individual sub-groups and tendencies measured, were 
averaged by calculating the Arithmetic Mean of the corres¬ 
ponding Fisher Z-Functions^, and the two sets of coefficients 
compared. Table III shows the comparison.

The fact that almost the same r was obtained for all the 
groups and traits by the much shorter method of averaging the 
Z-functions seemed to warrant its use in arriving at other 
coefficients of correlation. Table IV shows these other

CHAPTER FIVE 


SIGNIFICANCE OF DATA OBTAINED 

1. RELIABILITY OF OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS 

Table II shows coefficients of correlation ranging from 
.88 to .98. These are high correlations, but are they re¬ 
liable? Do they signifiy that both methods of scoring the 
Bemreuter Personality blanks yield substantially the same 
percentiles? Or could such high correlations be obtained 
by errors in sampling when, in fact, the true or parameter 
correlation between the scores obtained by the two methods 
is zero? 

The reliability of the obtained r’s was tested, first, 
against the null hypothesis. On the hypothesis that the 
correlation between the scores obtained by the two methods 
of scoring the Bemreuter blanks is zero, it is known that 
an r of .361, when N = 50, can be obtained by accidents of 
sampling. The r*s ranging from .88 to .98, make this 
hypothesis untenable, for correlations as high as .88 or 
.98, at the .01 level of significance, cannot be attributed 
to chance alone. That is to say, the probability that an 
obtained r could be as high as .88, if the true r is zero, 
is much less than one in a hundred. 

It may be inferred, therefore, that such high correla¬ 
tions are significant. In this thesis it is assumed that the 
construction of the Bennett Simplified scoring key is such

that percentiles obtained by its use correlate positively 
and highly with scores obtained when the same inventories are 
scored by the original Bernreuter method. 

The reliability of the obtained r*s was further tested by 
computing the limiting values of the corresponding parameter 
coefficients of correlation (r^). For an r of .90, when 
N = 50, using the Fisher Z-function formula^, the limiting 
values of r^ are .80 and .95. The obtained r of .90 lies 
within this range. 

When N is greater the limits of r^ are narrower still. 

For instance, in computing the r between the percentiles ob¬ 
tained by the two methods of scoring the inventories on all 
four B scales, 760 percentiles are compared. The limits of 
r^ are ,89 and .92. The obtained r is .91, virtually half-way 
between' the narrow limits ascertained for the true r. It is 
wholly conceivable that if several thousand percentile scores 
were to be compared, the true r and the obtained r would be 
identical. The close correspondence between the parameter r 
and the obtained r, especially for higher values of N, seems 
to justify the inference that the latter is highly reliable. 

Thus it is not only disproved that an r as high as ,91, 
when N = 760, can be obtained when the true r is zero, but it 
is also shown that the obtained r falls within the narrow 
limits ascertained for the true r.

2. SIGNIFICANCE OF OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS 

Having demonstrated the high reliability of the obtained 
r's, the question arises: Are the coefficients significant? 

If an r as high as .361, when N = 50j_, can be obtained by a 
sheer accident of sampling, when in reality no correlation 
exists, can it be tahen that r's ranging from .88 to .98 
signify some intrinsic feature of the Bennett Simplified system 
to yield, in a high proportion of cases, the same scores as the 
Bennett system? It has already been asserted that that is the 
inference2. It can further be substantiated that an r of ,90 
has an 80$ dependability. 

Garrett developed a formula by which he computes the 
coefficient of forecasting dependability. He designates the 
coefficient by the symbol E. The formula is 
E = X - J 1 - r2 

Table II shows that the coefficient of correlation between 
the scores on the Bl-N test (adult men) is .98. Applying the 
formula for dependability we find that E = .80, and the efficiency 
in predicting scores may be said to be 80$, That is, we can be 
certain eight times out of ten that the same percentile score 
can be obtained when the Bl-N test is scored by either the 
original Bernrenter method or by the Simplified Bennett system. 
Even an r as low as .88 has a predictive value of 50$; that is, 
halfway between no predictive value and perfect prediction.

3. SIGNIFICANCE* OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS 

Some differences between obtained r's were obtained. For 
instance, the coefficients of correlation on the B3-I scale 
range from .88 for College Women to ,97 for Adult Men. Since 
the same test, B3-I, was applied to independent samples, does 
it mean that one cannot rely with the same degree of certainty 
that the scores for the college women will correlate as highly 
as they do for adult men? Or does it mean that this difference 
may be attributed to errors in sampling, and that, in reality 
no difference exists? To answer these questions, this difference, 
as well as others, was tested for significance. 

The significance of the difference between the r's ob¬ 
tained when the B3-I scale was scored by the two methods for 
both College Women and Adult Men was tested first. Both samples 
contain 50 items. The coefficient of correlation (r^) for the 
first sample. College Women, is .88, The r for the other sample 
(r 2 ). Adult Men, is .97. Converted to Fisher Z-functions^ 
when r 2 = .97, Z 2 - 2,09; and when rq = .88, Zq = 1,38. 

Z 2 - Zi = 2.09 - 1,38 = .71 
The standard error of this difference is .21.

The critical, or test ratio, T, at the .01 level, is 2,56. 

That is, the hypothesis that the true difference between the 
two coefficients of correlation is zero is tenable when T is 
2.56 or less. T is obtained by dividing the difference between 
the two r's by the standard error of this difference, the r's 
being converted to Z-functions, as above. 

T, therefore, is .71/.21 or 3.4. Since it is greater than 
2.56, one might be tempted to reject the null hypothesis, and 
to conclude that the difference between the two r's is not a 
chance difference, nor the true or parameter difference actually 
zero and, therefore, of no significance. 

In other words, one might feel justified in concluding that, 
through some defect, the Bennett Simplified system of scoring 
the B3-I scale cannot be reliably used when the Berarenter in¬ 
ventory is•administered to adult men or to college women. Such 
a conclusion, however, is not justified. It cannot be stated 
with confidence that the correlation between the percentile 
scores of the adult men is higher than that between those scored 
by college women. The obtained r for the first group is between 
,94 and .98 which are the limits of the true r for that group; 
while the obtained r for the second is between .76 and .94. 

The true r for the first may be as low as .94, and the true r 
for the second as high as .94. In short, theoretically,the two 
may be the same. Consequently, the apparent difference may not 
be great enough to be significant. In terms of the null hypothesis, 
one cannot reject the possibility that the true difference is zero.

All the other differences between the obtained r*s were 
also tested and found, in terms of T, to be insignificant. 

It seems, therefore, that in fact there are no grounds for 
holding that any real differences between the obtained r*s 
exist. To put it positively, the two methods of scoring the 
Bemreuter inventories completed by any of the four sub¬ 
groups yield the same results, and may, therefore, be used 
interchangeably.

CHAPTER SIX 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

The findings of this investigation may now be summarized. 

Reliably high coefficients of correlation, ranging from 
,88 to ,98, between percentile scores obtained by the Bemreuter 
and the Bennett Simplified systems of scoring Bemreuter Persona¬ 
lity blanks were calculated by the Product-Moment (short) 
method. 

Table V shows the coefficients of correlation obtained in 
this investigation and those obtained by Bennett.

From the foregoing summary of findings it may he concluded 

that 

a. The Bernreuter and Bennett Systems of scoring the 
Bernreuter Inventories are interchangeable to a 
high degree. 

b. For the sake of economy of time and effort, the Bennett 
system may he used in preference to the Bernreuter. 

c. The use of the Bennett Simplified system of scoring 
Bernreuter Inventories completed hy groups of Canadian 
adults and College men and women is warranted.
