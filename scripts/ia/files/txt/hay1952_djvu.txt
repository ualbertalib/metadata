ABSTRACT 


Some compounds structurally related to colchinol 
methyl ether have been synthesized. These compounds are 
1-(3-methoxyphenyl)—3—(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine 
hydrochloride, N-acetyl-l-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4,5-tri- 
methoxyphenyl)-propylamine, N-acetyl-1- (4-methoxyphenyl)- 
3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine and l-(3-hydroxy- 
phenyl) -3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine. 

The reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldoxime by 
various reducing agents has been studied.

INTRODUCTION 


Colchicine is an alkaloid obtained from the seeds and corms of 
the autumn crocus. It is a capillary poison and large doses of it 
produce paralysis of the nervous system along with respiratory paralysis. 
For as yet unexplained reasons it also gives relief to those suffering 
from gout. 

The fact that colchicine inhibits cell division (1) led to 
its testing in the regression of tumours. At doses just sufficient 
to arrest cell division little effect on the growth of the tumour 
is discerned (2). Dosages just below the minimum lethal dose are 
necessary before any regression of tumour growth is noticed. At such 
high dose levels, however, hemorrhages are induced in the tumour and 
thus regression may be due to the destruction of the newly formed 
capillary endothelium in the tumours. 

Windaus (3) was the first to partially elucidate the structure 
for colchicine. He proposed formula I for it.

formula was necessary. Their work seemed to indicate that ring B 
in the Windaus formulashould be seven-membered and not six-membered 
This would give the following structure for colchinol methyl ether, 
an important degradation product of colchicine. 





This structure has recently been verified by synthesis (5). 

The structure for colchicine itself has not, to date, been 
completely elucidated. Dewar (6) proposed that rings B and G are 
both seven-membered. This has received some support (4@,7). 

Lettre^and co-workers (8) reported that certain 1,2-diphenyl 
ethylamines containing one or more methoxyl groups on one of the rings 
had the property of inhibiting cell division in certain cells in 
tissue cultures. 

This work was extended by Hartwell and Kornberg (9) who 
synthesized further substituted 1,2-diphenylethylamines. 

These compounds bear a close structural relationship to the 
Windaus structure for colchinol methyl ether as illustrated by the 
following formulae.

Since colchinol methyl ether has been shown to contain a 
seven-membered ring, it is obvious that the best open chain analogue 
of colchinol methyl ether would be an appropriately substituted 
1,3-diphenylpropylamine (III).

Certain of these substituted 1,3-diphenylpropylamines have 
been prepared by previous workers (10) and some of these have proved 
to have mild inhibitory properties (11). 

It was proposed to prepare as part of the work involved in 
this thesis, compound III which was to be isolated as the hydrochloride. 

A recent and private communication from Hartwell (11) at the 
National Cancer Institute has revealed that certain degredation products 
of colchicine possess inhibitory properties and are less toxic than 
the parent compound. That is, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is 
much greater than the minimum effective dose (MED) as shown by the 
following table.

N-acetylation increases the potency of the compounds tremendously. 

Accordingly it was proposed that the following compounds, 
open chain analogues of colchinol and colchinol methyl ether, be 
prepared.

None of these compounds has been synthesized previously, 
but the hydrochloride corresponding to compound VIII has been prepared 
by an earlier worker (10a). 




DISCUSSION 


Following a general procedure used by previous workers (10) 
for the preparation of substituted 1,3-diphenylpropylamines, one 
would expect the first step in the synthesis of l-(3-methoxyphenyl)- 
3-(3,4,5-triraethoxyphenyl)-propylamine (I) to be 


-a 0

The chalcones produced are generally.yellow, and melt at 
a relatively low temperature. From the above reaction, after pro¬ 
longed standing, two compounds were isolated. They were both white 
and melted at approximately 140 °C and 170°C, respectively, which 
is considerably higher than might be expected for the expected chalcone. 

The reaction between benzaldehyde and acetophenone has 
been studied (12) and found to give higher condensation products. 
Furthermore chalcone itself has been found to react further (13) with 
acetophenone to give the same higher condensation products via a 
Michael condensation. 

By analogy one would therefore expect the following reactions 
to occur with 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and methoxyacetophenone.

Unfortunately, compounds I and II, as well as the expected 
chalcone, have the same percentages of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
within experimental error. Therefore a carbon-hydrogen analysis does 
not serve to differentiate between them. Work on these compounds was 
not pursured further. 

Another worker in this laboratory (13) has done further 
work on these compounds. By reacting the stoichometric quantities 
of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and 3-methoxyacetophenone which 
might be expected to produce I, a compound was produced which was 
different from those previously produced. The compound proved to 
be I. Since compound II has two similar asymmetric carbon atoms, 
it would be expected to exist in three isomeric forms, d, 1, and 
meso. Therefore, the two compounds produced are probably isomeric 
forms of II. 

Wacek and Morghen (14) reported that chalcones containing 
a phenolic hydroxyl group could be boiled in alkali without producing 
higher condensation products. This prompted the following reaction:

This compound could be prepared in excellent yield. 

A search of the literature revealed that no chalcones have 
been synthesized with methoxyl group in the B ring at the 3* position. 

To understand why one compound undergoes a further Michael 
condensation one must go into the inductive and resonance effects 
produced by the phenolate ion and methoxyl group respectively. 
Inductive Effect

Resonance Effect 



The unhindered polarization of the carbonyl group in the 
molecule would produce the following effect; 


X 




When X is a phenolate ion, both the inductive and resonance effects 
oppose this polarization of the carbonyl, whereas, when X is a methoxyl 
the inductive effect aids, the resonance effect hinders the polarization. 
The directing influence of the phenolate ion is also greater than 
that of the methoxyl, therefore, the hindrance of polarization of the 
carbonyl by the other group is greater when that group is a phenolate

Since the carbonyl carbon will now be less positive, the

prominent and the hydrogens on the adjacent methyl group will then 
be less positive than when a methoxyl group is in the ring. This 
would mean that it would be less likely to undergo the Michael 
reaction and so would not give the further condensation products. 

Using the hydroxy chalcone the scheme for the synthesis 
of I is illustrated by the following flow sheet.

The synthesis of any of the propylamines containing an

is unsuccessful with phenols (15) producing higher condensation

hydrochalcone produced a small yield of the amine. The most successful 
method was found to be reduction with hydrogen and Raney nickel at 
1000 psi and 85° (16) for one hour. This produced an excellent yield 
of the amine. The route for the synthesis of l-(3-hydroxyphenyl)- 
3-(3,4>5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine would be illustrated by the

That is, by some means the para-methoxy group had been 
replaced by hydrogen. This phenomenon is by no means new (18,19). 

It was therefore suggested that the reduction of V with

reducing agents be studied. The reducing agents selected were:

Of these four reducing agents, it was found that sodium in 
absolute ethanol was the only one in which the para-methoxy group 
was replaced by hydrogen. This reduction gave VI, isolated as the

E. Schwenk et al (20) found that treatment of VIII with 



Raney nickel in alkaline solution did not result in replacement of 
the para-methoxy group with hydrogen, but when the ortho, para directing 
amino group was replaced by a meta directing group, as in IX, hydro- 
genolysis to benzoic acid readily occured. To understand why hydro- 
genolysis occurs in one case and not in another, one must consider 
the resonance structures for the two molecules.

In X, the resonance effects of the two groups, which are 
both ortho, para directing, are opposed. Thus the bond between the 
methoxy group and the aromatic nucleus is going to be more aliphatic 
in character than that in XI in which the two groups are in conjugation. 
Thus, hydrogenolysis should occur more readily in XI because we can 
have an attack at the electronically deficient oxygen atom to give XII 




which on rearrangement could split out a molecule of methanol. 


The same workers also noted that when XIII was treated in the

same manner it was recovered unchanged. This is probably due to the 
steric inhibition of resonance by the two adjacent methoxy groups. 

This would make the bond between the para-methoxy group more aliphatic 
in nature than that in para-methoxybenzoic acid, and thus would be 
harder to split. 

This should explain why the para-methoxy group is not replaced 
by hydrogen in XIV or XV when treated with sodium amalgam, lithium 
aluminum hydride, or low pressure hydrogenation. 

The fact that the para-methoxy group is replaced when reduction 
takes place with sodium in absolute ethanol suggests that something 
besides hvdrogenolysis may be occuring. In the Bouveault-Blane reduction 
of esters to alcohols (21) with sodium and alcohol it has been shorn that 
"The formation of hydrogen by the interaction of sodium and alcohol 
serves no useful purpose." Sodium, itself, takes an actual part in the 
reaction. It is also known that intermediates such as XVI exist (22).

EXPERIMENTAL 


All melting points are uncorrected. 

3,4.5 -T r imethoxyben z aid eh yd e 

It was prepared by the method of McFadyen and Stephens as 
outlined by Buchanan, Cook and Loudon (4d). Distillation at reduced 
pressure gave a product of sufficient purity ibr further steps. 

3-Nitroacetoohenone 

The method developed by Cobb (23) involving nitration of 
acetophenone at a temperature less than -20° was found to be most 
satisfactory. 

3-Aminoacetoohenone 

Thirty grams of 3-nitroacetophenone was dissolved in 200 ml. 
of ethyl acetate, 0.05 g. of Adam’s platinum oxide catalyst was added, 
and then submitted to hydrogenation at 50 p.s.i. When a drop in pressure 
corresponding to theoretical was obtained the solution was filtered 
free of platinum and the ethyl acetate removed under reduced pressure. 

The 3-aminoacetophenone obtained was practically pure, m.p. 93-94.5°. 

3-Hydroxyaceto'phenone 

This was prepared by the usual method of diazotization and 
hydrolysis of the resulting diazonium salt. It was necessary to 
purify the material by recrystallizing twice from water using Norit 
if it is to be used for the preparation of chaleones. 

3-Lethoxyacetophenone 

Thirty grams of 3-hydroxyacetophenone was dissolved in 150 ml. 
of 30$ sodium hydroxide solution. After cooling to 15°, 30 ml. of 
dimethylsulfate was added slowly with stirring over a period of 20

minutes. Thirty ml. more of dimethylsulfate was then added over a 
period of 10 minutes. The solution was then refluxed for two hours, 
cooled, and extracted with benzene. The 3-methoxyacetophenone was 
obtained by distillation at reduced pressure (b.p. l60°/3 mm.) 

3 .3*.4.5-Tetramethoxychalcone 

A. To a solution of 1.96 g. of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde 
and 1.5 g. of 3-methoxyacetophenone in 10 ml. methanol in the cold 
was added a solution of 0.2 g. of sodium in 5 ml. of methanol. The 
solution was allowed to attain room temperature and then let stand. 
After approximately two weeks a small amount of white material pre¬ 
cipitated out of solution. Recrystallization from ethanol afforded 
some white fluffy crystals, m.p. 170-171°. This was obviously not the 
expected chalcone. The analysis, as reported by another worker (10a), 
agreed within experimental error with that of the chalcone or its 
higher condensation products. 

B. Three grams of 3-methoxyacetophenone and 3.9 g. of 3,4,5- 
trimethoxybenzaldehyde were dissolved in 30 ml. of ethanol containing 
0.5 g. of sodium hydroxide. Water was added to the cloud point 

(15 ml.) and the mixture was then shaken for two hours after which 
it was allowed to stand overnight. A yellow oil settled out which 
would not solidify. The material was distilled at reduced pressure 
(l60°/3 cm.) and yielded an oil which when recrystallized from ethanol 
afforded 2.5 g. of white material, m.p. 140-141°. 

3.4.5-Trimethoxy-3 1 -hydroxychalcone 

Three grams of 3-hydroxyacetophenone and 4.3 g. of 3,4,5- 
trimethoxybenzaldehyde were dissolved in 25 ml. boiling methanol. 

This solution was cooled in ice until a white, flocculent precipitate

cooled solution of potassium hydroxide ( 30 $) in methanol was added. 

The mixture was allowed to stand for six hours with occasional shaking. 
The bulk of the methanol was then removed at reduced pressure leaving 
a thick orange paste which was dissolved in water and extracted with 
ether to remove any unreacted aldehyde. Acidification of the aqueous 
layer with dilute hydrochloric acid, while cooling internally with ice, 
yielded a yellow oil which solidified almost immediately. Recrystalli¬ 
zation from ethanol afforded 6.0 g. (87$) of beautiful yellow material, 

m.p. 173-174°.

Reduction by Low Fressure Hydrogenation 

Fifteen grains (0.0071 moles) of oxime was dissolved in 
25 ml. of ethanol containing 0.021 moles of hydrogen chloride. This 
was shaken at 50 p.s.i. in the low pressure hydrogenation apparatus 
for six hours using Adam’s platinum oxide catalyst (0.05 g.). The 
platinum was filtered off and the ethanol removed in vacuo. The 
residue was dissolved in ether and the ether treated as before to 
give a white hydrochloride with m.p. 140-170°. Repeated recrystallization 
from ethanol-ether gave a small amount of material which softens at 
205° and completely melts at 215°. Mixed m.p. with material from 
sodium in ethanol reduction, softens at 195°, melts at 205°. Mixed 
m.p. with material from lithium aluminum hydride reduction, softens 
at 210°, melts at 215°.
