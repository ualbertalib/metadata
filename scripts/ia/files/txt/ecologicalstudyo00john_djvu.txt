ABSTRACT 


Concern over the declining moose population prompted 
the Alberta Game Branch and the University of Alberta to 
begin investigations in 1951 into possible solutions to 
the problem. It was felt that altering of the sex ratio 
by the shooting of cows might have a beneficial effect 
and the first studies were directed towards determining 
the feasibility of such a plan. The former Athabaska 
Forest Reserve was chosen as the study area by reason of 
its isolation and relatively good moose population. Later 
studies were expanded to cover the entire ecology of the 
moose in one portion of the Reserve - the Rock Lake area. 

A series of 55 skulls was collected and measured 
in an effort to determine the exact taxonomic status of 
the moose in the area. 

Observations were made whenever possible in an 
effort to determine the numbers of moose present, the 
sex ratio and rate of reproduction. These factors were 
considered vital in the consideration of the justification 
of opening the season on cows. The history of the moose 
in the area was considered briefly in order to relate the 
present conditions to the past. 

Notes were made on behaviour, appearance and general 
life history etc., to supplement information already known 


about the animals

ii 


Studies on feeding habits, browse plot analyses, 
fecal pellet and stomach analyses were all carried out 
in an effort to determine the major winter and summer 
food plants of the moose around Rock Lake. 

Considerable work was done on the natural salt licks 
in an effort to determine the elements which were sought 
after by the moose. Soil and water from each of twelve 
licks were analysed for soluble salts and salt troughs 
containing 19 different chemicals were set up to see which 
salts were preferred by the animals. Results from this 
last experiment were rather inconclusive. 

Three moose - two bulls’and one cow-were shot in 
September and complete autopsies were performed on them. 
Specimens of all internal organs were submitted to the 
Provincial Veterinary Laboratory for pathological study. 
Stomach contents were analysed in connection with food 
studies. 

The relationships of the moose to other species in 
the area, including predators, were studied and discussed 
at some length. 

The effects of the open season in 1952 on the moose 


were also considered

AN ECOLOGICAL STUDY OP THE MOOSE 
IN THE 

ROCK LAKE AREA OP ALBERTA 

INTRODUCTION 

The decline in the moose population across Canada 
in recent years has aroused considerable interest and 
concern in wildlife circles. As a result, nearly every 
province, Alberta included, has embarked upon some 
research project in the effort to solve at least some 
of the factors involved in the decline of these majestic 
game animals. 

In 1951 the Game Branch of the Alberta Provincial 
Government, in conjunction with the University of Alberta, 
decided to initiate a study of the moose in the western 
portion of this province. The original objective of the 
study was to determine whether or not the situation in 
the proposed study area was satisfactory for carrying on 
experiments in hunting of both bulls and cows. 

On the basis of hunting data from Sweden (Skunke, 
1950) where the killing of both sexes has been legal for 
many years, it is apparent that the Swedish moose 
population has been maintained at a high level in spite 
of the killing of females. It Is this fact which Inspired 
local game authorities to consider the possibility of 
instituting an open season on cow moos© as a means of

increasing the population. Although this latter statement 
may, at first glance, appear rather absurd its significance 
becomes apparent when one considers that in a population 
where the sex ratio is disproportionate a large percentage 
of the cows will not be bred and hence are not contributing 
to the population increase® 

It was generally felt that such a radical change in 
hunting practice should be preceded by a limited experiment 
to determine its effectiveness. Therefore it was decided 
to select a suitable area as a test hunting ground where 
all hunting activities could be rigidly regulated. The 
area chosen for the survey was that tract of land lying 
north of the Athabaska River and east of Jasper National 
Park which constituted the former Athabaska Forest Reserve. 
The wide diversity of terrain within the area was such 
that most of the normal habitats frequented by moose were 
available for study. These varied from subalpine swales 
to typical northland muskeg. As a secondary consideration, 
this same area possessed numbers of every other notable 
big game species, including sheep, goat, ©Ik, deer and 
bear, which might have an effect on the ecology of the 
moose. The single means of entry into the Reserve through 
the Ranger Station at Entrance makes it ideal for a test 
hunting area since close to a hundred percent check can be 
made on all hunting activities with a minimum of effort.

The summer of 1951 was spent travelling throughout 
the Reserve in an effort to get a general idea of the 
game situation and to locate the most favorable location 
to carry on further possible studies. During the four 
months from May to September nearly 1000 miles were 
travelled by horseback and most of the Reserve south of 
the Smoky River was investigated. The results of the 
preliminary investigations were not such as to favor the 
institution of an open season on cows since reports 
received and personal observations indicated a fairly 
well balanced sex ratio. However, subsequent studies 
have indicated otherwise and at the present time such a 
project seems quite feasible. 

Since the primary objective of the study had been, 
to all intents and purposes, achieved it was decided that 
further studies in the Reserve should take the form of 
an investigation into the general ecology of the moose 
in the area. On the basis of the 1951 investigations 
the Rock Lake region was selected as the most suitable 
site for making moos© studies. This area lies forty 
miles north and slightly west of Jasper just outside 
the northeastern boundary of Jasper National Park. The 
summer of 1952, from May 25 to October 9, was spent in 
this location making the various investigations which

are the basis of this thesis. All field work was carried 
out on foot (an average of 10 miles a day and as high as 
35) during the summer and considerable time and effort 
were expended in becoming as familiar as possible with the 
study area. Several lookout points, from which most of 
the observations were made, were set up but much of the 
time was spent investigating out-of-the-way corners of 
the terrain for possible points of interest. 

Although all aspects of moose ecology are dealt with 
three facets - taxonomy, foods and salt licks - were found 
to be of particular interest and are therefore most strongly 
stressed. Technically speaking, taxonomy is not actually 
a part of ecology but it most certainly is basic to any 
general study of an animal in a new area and hence is 
given consideration in this thesis. 

Unfortunately it was impossible to make any winter 
observations and the writer has had to rely upon the 
reports of trappers and forest rangers for information 
on the wintering habits of the moose in the area. 

The map of the Athabaska Forest Reserve on page 5 
will serve to give some impression of the location of 
the study area. Routes followed in 1951 are indicated 
by heavy black lines and the 1952 study area is set out 
by pink shading.

DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY AREA 


The Reserve as a whole contains an extremely wide 
variety of terrain. In the east it is reminiscent of 
the northland. with its low pine ridges and expanses of 
black spruce muskeg cut through by streams winding about 
in shallow park-like valleys. As one progresses westward 
into the foothills the pine and spruce-clad ridges become 
more prominent and the muskeg areas more restricted. The 
extreme western portion of the Reserve lies within the 
outlying ranges of the Rocky Mountains and presents in 
itself a range of habitat types such as only the Cordilleran 
regions are capable of producing. Narrow, rocky gorges 
suddenly blossom into wide, open subalpine valleys. 

Densely timbered slopes of Engelmann spruee ; alpine fir } and 
lodgepole pine alternate with the more exposed grassy 
inclines. 

Rock Lake, a body of water one and one half miles 
long and three quarters of a mile wide, lies about thirty 
five miles northwest of Entrance and just within the 
western fringes of the Reserve where it impinges on 
Jasper National Park. The study area lies wholly within 
the Wildhay River watershed and is drained by Rock Creek, 
which enters Rock Lake from the northwest, and the north 
fork of the Wildhay River which also flows from the north¬ 
west to join the center fork about three quarters of a

mile after it leaves Hock Lake* 

The terrain around the lake is one of vegetation- 
covered ridges rising from the flat, glaciated valleys 
of Rock Creek and the Wildhay River to an altitude of 
6000 to 7000 feet* The lake itself is at an elevation 
of 4500 feet* As one moves back from the lake the 
mountains become more and more rugged, rising to become 
9-10,000 foot rocky bastions which encircle the lake as 
it lies within the first outlying ramparts of the Rocky 
Mountains* 

The nearby ridges themselves offer a wide rang© of 
vegetational types* The north and east facing slopes 
are covered with heavy spruce-pine-fir canopies while the 
west and south slopes show a mixture of grassy meadows, 
poplar bluffs and lodgepole pine stands, depending on the 
particular n lay of the land”* The bottom lands around the 
lake, formerly grassy meadows, are now growing up to 
willow pasture and poplar bluffs* Much of the country was 
burned over about the turn of the century and has grown up 
to lodgepole pine cover which is slowly giving way to 
Engelmann and white spruce in the more favorable locations. 
The last large fire in the region occurred in the early 
thirties and these burned tracts are now growing up in 
young pine, poplar and willow, interspersed with grassy 
patches.

TAXONOMIC STATUS OF THE MOOSE 

Dr. R. L. Peterson of the Royal Ontario Museum has, 
through his recent moose studies (1949), determined that 
an area of overlap between the geographical races Alces 
americana andersoni and Ao_ cU_ shirasi exists in the 
region along the north central B.C. - Alberta boundary. 

As the proposed limits of the overlap region lie quite 
close to the present study area it was deemed advisable 
to determine, if possible, which race is present or if 
there has been an intergrading of the two. Since some of 
the basic differences in the two races occur in certain 
skull dimensions it was decided to collect all skulls 
noted during the summer in order to compile as large a 
series of measurements as possible. A collection of 52 
skulls, 33 bulls and 19 cows, was obtained from over 70 
moose skeletons located within a six mile radius of camp. 
In addition, measurements were also taken from the skulls 
of the three animals shot on special permit so that In 
all a total of 55 skulls was measured during the summer. 
Of these only 28 were complete but the vital measurements 
(width of palate and length of toothrow) were obtained 
from all 55. 

Tables 3 and 4 contain the summarized measurements 
of all skulls, both male and female, collected in 1952.

In order that a comparison can be easily made Peterson f s 
tables (Tables 1 and 2) on bull measurements for both 
A. £. andersoni and A. a. shirasi are included. In 
addition, a complete table of all skull measurements 
from the 55 specimens collected is to be found in the 
Appendix. 

Mastoid breadth measurements In my tables should be 
ignored as incorrect interpretation of this measurement 
in the field has invalidated the figures. Since the 
mastoid measurements are incorrect the ratio of the 
height of the occiput to the mastoid breadth must also be 
disregarded. However, on the basis of three male skulls 
retained in the University of Alberta collections it 
appears that the correct measurement coincides closely 
with that given for A. < a. andersoni . 

Peterson (1951, 1952) considers the flare of the 
nasal aperture and the ratio of least palatal width to 
length of upper toothrow crowns (in bulls) to be the 
significant criteria for separating A. a. andersoni from 
A. a. shirasi . Pigs. 8 & 9 (page 16) Illustrate the 
exact nature of these measurements. Nearly all other 
measurements show some variation between the subspecies 
but the degree of overlap is such that it is impossible 
to use them as valid criteria for determining the taxonomy 
of the specimens.

It was found that most of the skull measurements, 
including percent nasal flare, coincided very closely 
with those given for A. a. andersoni . However, the ratio 
of the least palatal width to the length of upper toothrow 
crowns showed definite shirasi influence* The mean value 
given for shirasi is 41.4$, for andersoni 38*3$, while 
the value calculated from specimens collected in 1952 was 
42.1$±.69$. In the light of these data it seems logical 
to conclude that, while the population Is predominantly 
andersoni , some shirasi influence Is present* Therefore 
I believe that the range of overlap between the two 
subspecies can justifiably be extended north to include 
the Rock Lake area. This is some 60 miles north of the 
previously known limit of overlap at Southesk Lake, Jasper 
National Park*. Peterson (correspondence) concurs with 
the suggestion of extending the range of overlap to the 
Rock Lake area. 

For all practical purposes the moose of the study 
area around Rock Lake may be considered to be intergrades 
between A. a. andersoni and A. a. shirasi .

tables of cranial measurements a list of the definitions

HISTORY OF THE MOOSE IN THE AREA 

Moberly (1929) records that moose were plentiful 
in the area north of Jasper House in the fall of 1855. 
Seventy-seven animals were killed on a hunting trip 
north from Lac Brule to the Smoky River, a distance of 
roughly 100 miles. Moose were still numerous when he 
left the area in 1860. 

Stan Clark and other early residents of the area 
report that moose were absent from Rock Lake in 1913 and 
first appeared In 1919. At that time the Indians 
considered the moose to be drifting In from the northeast. 
In the early 1930* s the moose reached a population peak 
and then declined to a low in the early 40 1 a., At the 
present time most residents feel that the moose are on 
the upswing but have not regained the numbers known in 
the 30 1 s. 

Several writers have remarked on the fact that the 
moos© appear to exhibit some cyclic behaviour with a 
periodicity of roughly thirty years. This phenomenon 
has also been noted in some other big game species but 
as yet no positive cycle has been determined. 

The absence of moose from the area in 1913 could 
conceivably be attributed to the extensive forest fires 
which are reported to have ravaged the mountains and

foothills around the turn of the century. Observations 
made in 1951 indicated that vast tracts of the Reserve 
had been denuded about fifty years ago. If the denudation 
was as complete as supposed it seems safe to assume that 
the moose were driven from much of the Reserve at that 
time. If the animals were driven from a large enough 
area it is not inconceivable to assume that it might take 
them fifteen to twenty years to repopulate the entire 


tract

POPULATION AND DISTRIBUTION 

Population Estimate 

One hundred and three observations totalling 1267 
moose minutes (one moose minute is the unit of time 
describing the observation of one moose for one minute) 
were made in the course of the summer. It was possible 
to identify several individual animals through coat color 
peculiarities, presence of a calf or the size and shape 
of antlers. On this basis it was estimated that the 103 
observations involvief roughly 25 animals. Of these 
perhaps 20 were seen ranging in the immediate vicinity 
of Rock Lake., 

With the limited amount of data available any 
proposed population estimate for the study area is bound 
to be open to considerable error. However, I believe 
that, by correlating several factors, it is possible to 
arrive at a reasonable estimate. 

Prom my observations during the summer the sex ratio 
appeared to be one bull to three cows. Six separate bulls 
seen in one three hour period on June 24 would, on the 
basis of the observed sex ratio, represent one fourth of 
the adult population - in this case 24 animals. The 
observations were made at a salt lick during a particularly 
busy period of utilization. However, it is extremely 





24 


unlikely that the entire bull population wat congregated 
at that time and therefore the adult population would 
certainly be more than 24 animals. To this, of course, 
must be added the juvenile population of 6 or 8 animals,, 

Hosley (1949), in summarizing various population 
figures, states that over large areas one moose per 
square mile can be supported indefinitely without damage 
to the food supply. In my estimation it seems that this 
figure could be considered valid for the Rock Lake area. 
The valley floors form most excellent ranges and concent¬ 
rations of moose In these localities certainly exceed 
one per square mile. However, when one considers the 
extensive timber slopes which have no value as moose 
range I think the figure of one animal per square mile 
is quite within reason. Browse studies indicated that 
the basic food species were not being utilized as fully 
as they might and therefore it may be assumed that the 
population Is well within the limit of one animal per 
square mile which the area can support. The area most 
intensively studied involved about fifty square miles 
so, on the basis of the above data, it is estimated that 
the moose population was between 30 and 40 animals. 

Rangers who spent part of the winter at Rock Lake 
report that it was quite common to see from 12 to 15 
animals daily on the flats below the lake. Considering

that equally good, and more extensive, feeding grounds 
lie above the lake and up the north fork of the Wildhay 
River, I should venture the opinion that the animals 
seen below the lake represented roughly one third of the 
population. Recent reports from Rock Lake indicate that 
fewer moose are using the lake flats this winter than at 
previous times. This could conceivably be the result of 
the extremely mild winter which has allowed the animals 
to move up to higher ranges normally made inaccessible 
at this time of year. 

On the basis of the information presented above I 
have estimated that the moose population in the area 
around Rock Lake, prior to the 1952 hunting season, 
was between thirty and forty animals. At least six 
moose were known to have been killed in the area last 
fall. Three of these, two bulls and a cow, were taken 
personally on a special permit while the other three, 
two bulls and a cow, were shot during the regular season. 
The cow apparently was killed by mistake but no further 
data was available concerning it. 

Distribution Within the Study Area 

The largest proportion of the observations was 
made on or adjacent to the lowlying flats at either end 
of the lake and, while this might be attributed in part

to the open nature of the terrain, it seems to indicate 
that these constitute the most favored moose pastures in 
the area. It is also interesting to note that, of the 
103 observations, all but fifteen were made prior to 
July 3rd and after September 1st. It is quite apparent 
then that during the hotter and more fly-infested months 
of July and August the moose leave the lower flats for 
the higher and more timbered areas. However, this is 
merely a generalized shift and occasional animals remain 
in their old haunts at least part of the time. The 
importance of natural salt licks to the moose can be 
judged by the fact that of the 15 observations made during 
July and August 10 were at the salt licks at lower levels. 

The winter distribution of the moose was roughly 
determined through frequency of fecal droppings and shed 
antlers. As had been anticipated the animals concentrated 
on the lower flats but it was surprising to note the 
occurrence of winter pellets and shed antlers on mountain 
tops around timberline. This can be explained in part by 
the fondness of moose for alpine fir which grows more 
plentifully at higher altitudes and for which they 
undoubtedly range upward during mild spells. Hatter 
(1946, 1950) reports that several well defined migrations 
of forty to sixty miles from summer to winter range are

known in Central B.C.. To the best of my knowledge there 
is no such lengthy shift in the Rock Lake area. Certainly 
none of the local inhabitants ha$ remarked on such a 
phenomenon. 

The locations of the 70 or more moose skeletons 
discovered during the summer present an interesting 
point on distribution. With possibly five exceptions 
all carcasses were found along the fringes of, or in 
close proximity to, timber stands. Moose are by nature 
animals of the woodlands and it is therefore to be 
expected that they would seek cover in times of stress. 
However, only rarely was a carcass ever found any distance 
within a large timber tract. Lack of suitable browse 
normally keeps the moose from frequenting the interiors 
of large timber tracts and from the carcasses it would 
appear that even when hard pressed, either by predators 
or for other reasons, these animals will avoid penetrating 
heavy timber to any distance. 

The locations of moose observed and carcasses noted 
are plotted on figs. 10 & 11, which occur on pages 50 
and 31.

DATA ON AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS 

In view of the extreme diversity of terrain it was 
felt that aerial photos would provide a far clearer 
impression of the area than could be set forth on any 
outline maps. Therefore all data which would normally 
be recorded on maps are plotted on the two aerial photos 
which follow. In order to simplify study of the map it 
might be well to mention that the lightest areas 
represent grassy slopes or flats and the darker portions 
the timbered tracts. In general, the gradation from 
light to dark in the photos represents two stages of 
forest regeneration in addition to the mature 
which are the darkest portions.

SEX RATIO AND REPRODUCTION 

Calculated Sex Ratio 

Of the 103 observations made in 1952 the breakdown 
according to sex and age is as follows: 


Unidentified -- 20 

Adult females - 50 

Adult males ----- 16 

Calves--- 9 

Yearlings ----—- 8 


Disregarding the unidentified animals the apparent sex 
ratio is one bull to three cows* The validity of this 
ratio may be altered by the fact that cows are more in 
evidence at certain times than bulls and vice versa. 

Cows will frequent dense cover when their calves are 
young (Hosley, 1949) and bulls are inclined to remain 
in thickets during antler formation. However, it can 
probably be assumed that over the entire season the 
variations will even out fairly well and the observed 
ratio may be considered reasonably accurate. 

The problem of polygamy in moose has been a point of 
contention for some time now but the general concensus of 
opinion at present (Hosley , 1949; Pimlott, 1949) seems to 
be that limited polygamy does exist. On the basis of 
discussions with local trappers and personal observations

it would appear that a bull may spend several days with a 
cow waiting for her to come into heat. When one considers 
that the breeding season is only roughly four weeks long 
(September 18 to October 18 at Rock Lake) it becomes 
apparent that a bull could serve not more than three or 
four cows at best. In view of the fact that the breeding 
is tapering off by October 10th the chances of a bull 
serving three or four cows is extremely unlikely. Although 
cases of bull moose keeping small harems have been reported 
it would seem that this is not the common practice (Hatter, 
1950)o One young bull was seen to be in association with 
two cows just prior to the rut but in the one other case 
noted the bull had a single cow with him. 

At this point I would like to mention a rather 
interesting fact brought to light during the course of my 
skull collecting activities. The living sex ratio was 
calculated to be three cows to one bull but the past sex 
ratio, as based on skeletons found, was 2,2 bulls to one 
cow - practically a direct reversal, 1 In considering 
possible factors responsible for the heavy bull mortality 
sport hunting can be generally disregarded since, prior 
to the opening of the road into the lake three years ago, 
the area was used only by a small number of hunting parties 
packing in with horses. Hunting by local residents may be 
considered negligible since only one trapper winters at

Rock Lake and there are no Indians in the area. Also, 
on the basis of local information, I believe that natives 
etc., when hunting for meat are more inclined to take the 
female of the species since the meat is conceded to be of 
better quality. If, as many suppose, the bulls are more 
susceptible to predation some change between the living 
and dead sex ratios might be expected. However, it seems 
very unlikely that the bulls would be z.S times as 
vulnerable as the ratios indicate. Therefore, the only 
hypothesis I can offer for this unusual sex ratio in the 
skeletal remains is that in past years the sex ratio was 
on a much more even basis than it is at present. 

The 3:1 sex ratio occurring at Rock Lake in 1952, 
while not critical, may be considered not entirely 
favorable. The opening of the hunting season on bull 
moose in the fall of 1952 will undoubtedly have resulted 
in the sex ratio becoming increasingly disproportionate. 

I believe that if hunting is to be carried out at all in 
the Reserve an open season on cows should also be declared 
in order to keep the sex ratio within reasonable proportions. 

Rate of Reproduction 

Although there is considerable variation It would 
appear that under normal circumstances not more than half 

of the cows produce calves each year (Peterson, 1949).

In 1952 at Rock Lake only 17.6$ of the cows seen had 
calves with them. This represents an annual increment 
to the adult population of 10.4$ - about half of the 
normally expected increase (Hosley, 1949). The eight 
yearling observations represent an increase of 9.3$ for 
1951, a figure which seems to correlate with the 1952 
increase rather well considering that the 1951 offspring 
have undergone one winter of predation etc.. From the 
above figures it is apparent that the average population 
increase is around 10$. The 9.3$ increase for 1951 may 
well be considered above average in view of the light 
degree of predation which occurred in the area during 
the winter of 1951-52. Cowan (1946) considered that a 
yearling crop of 6$ of the adult herd in Jasper National 
Park was too low to sustain the herd. Therefore, on the 
basis of the data presented above it would appear that 
the moose around Rock Lake are reproducing at a rate 
sufficient to sustain the herd but not to allow any 
appreciable increase in the population. This agrees with 
the opinion expressed by most of the local residents that 
the moose are holding their own but not increasing to any 
great extent. 

Peterson (1949) considers twinning to occur in roughly 
one quarter of the births in Ontario while other invest¬ 
igators (Hosley, 1949) make estimates of twinning

occurring in 10-50$ of the births. However, in the two 
summers spent in the Athabaska Forest Reserve I did not 
at any time see a cow with twin calves. One report of a 
cow seen in 1951 with twin yearlings was received and a 
young cow and yearling bull seen together in July 1952 
could possibly have been twins. Reports from Ranger 
Currat at Hay River Ranger Station indicated that he 
considered twinning in the Reserve to be far less common 
than in the Lac La Biche area where he had previously 
been stationed. All in all, it appears that the birth 
of twin moose calves in the Rock Lake area is rather 
uncommon. 

The low rate of reproduction in the study area is 
likely the result of a number of factors. There is no 
doubt that predation by wolves and bears accounts for 
some calves and that still others are lost through disease 
and accident (see fig, 12), Many investigators (Hatter, 
1950; Peterson, 1949) feel that the mortality rate among 
very young calves is extremely high. It is also quite 
possible that the extremely low rate of twinning in the 
area may partially account for the rate of reproduction 
being lower than in areas where the frequency of twins 
is higher. However, I feel that the critical factor in 
keeping the rate of reproduction at a low level Is the 
adult sex ratio. Hatter (1946) found that in central

B.C. the calf crop was highest where the adult sex ratio 
approached 1:1. In Sweden where the moose population 
has been maintained at a high level for many years, the 
sex ratios in 1936-37 were roughly 1:1 (Skunke, 1949). 
Thus it appears that where maximum reproduction occurs 
the bulls and cows are in equal proportions.

LIFE HISTORY 


Many aspects of the life history of the moose are 
still subject to much dispute. Therefore, I shall 
attempt to set forth the most generally accepted views, 
supplemented by such personal observations as I was able 
to make in the course of the past two summers. 

Calves are born during the latter part of May and 
early June around Rock Lake. In 1951 the first calf was 
reported on May 25th. A calf seen on June 3, 1952, was 
evidently a week or so old. These dates fit in well with 
observations made over the years by other investigators 
(Hosley, 1949; Peterson, 1949). Though varying degrees 
of twinning have been recorded single calves appear to 
be the rule In the study area. The gestation period is 
about 240 days or eight months (Seton, 1929)« Hatter 
(1950) suggests the possibility of two estral periods 
during the breeding season with the result that some 
calves are born much later than the others. All calves 
seen in 1952 appeared to be of a uniform age and therefore, 
insofsr as the Rock Lake studies are concerned, the 
hypothesis is still open to question. 

The fact that a cow moose will defend her young Is 
indisputable (Hosley, 1949) but in most Instances, if the 
calf is not too young, the cow will resort to flight rather

than stand her ground. In only one of the several personal 
encounters I had with cows and young calves did the cow 
show any indication of belligerence. This consisted of 
laying her ears back, bristling her mane and stamping her 
forefeet. As I circled her to draw closer through some 
sizeable timber she paced about nervously then broke and 
slowly trotted away with the calf following* In all 
other cases the cows merely trotted into the nearest 
cover when aroused. The reaction of cows with calves to 
humans appears to vary considerably. Though I personally 
had no difficulties the rangers informed me that In the 
spring of 1950 the cows were extremely belligerent for 
some time. A report from two local Indians concerning 
the killing of a calf moose by a grizzly seems to indicate 
that the cow will hesitate to actively fight this predator 
in defense of her calf. 

The calves grow rapidly and by the end of July appeared 
to be about the size of a small mule deer, Yearlings are 
considered to weigh 400-600 pounds (Trippensee, 1948) 
but unless seen with adults or at close range it was found 
difficult to distinguish them. 

The calf will remain with the cow through the winter 
and, unless another calf is born the following spring It 
may continue to accompany her for the second summer. If 
a new calf is born the yearling is driven off before the

birth occurs.(Trippensee, 1948). The fact that no cows 
were seen with yearlings after about midsummer suggests 
that the young are set on their own well before their 
second winter, even if a new calf is not born. 

According to weight figures given by Trippensee, 
(1948) moose attain their full stature at about 5-4 years 
of age and reach their prime at 7 or 8 years. At least 
that is the age at which the bulls develop the finest 
sets of antlers. Sexual maturity is believed to be 
reached by both sexes at two years of age. The exact 
age to which moose will live is not certain but Skunke 
(1949) states that the Swedish moose attain an age of 
17-18 years. 

The pattern of antler development in bulls has been 
extensively described by many authors (Hosley, 1949; 
Peterson, 1949). Small nubbins are developed by the 
calves during their first summer but the first real set 
of spikes develop during the second summer. In general 
forked spikes develop in the second set of antlers (third 
summer) though in some cases they may occur in the first 
set. A skull bearing one single spike and one forked 
spike was found in 1952. The third set of antlers shows 
the beginning of palmation and the fourth set assumes 
adult conformation on a miniature scale. It is generally 
considered that the bulls attain full antler development

at an age of 7-10 years, after which they become smaller 
and heavier of beam. Undoubtedly there is considerable 
freakish development in the antler structure and in 1951 
one instance of a double prong developing from the lower 
side of the palm was noted. 

Antlers are progressively developed earlier and shed 
earlier as the animal grows older. In prime bulls 
development begins in April and the antlers are shed in 
December or early January. The 1952-53 season at Hock 
Lake appears to have been abnormal in that mature bulls 
were still seen with their antlers in early February. 

The rubbing of the velvet from the antlers signals 
the onset of the reproductive cycle and In the Rock Lake 
area this seems to occur in late August or early September. 
A three year old bull was noted with clean antlers on 
September 9th and a mature bull with the velvet partially 
removed was reported several days prior to that. 

During late September and early October a special 
effort was made to gather as much Information as possible 
on the mating activities of the moose, A young bull was 
seen consorting with a cow as early as September 16 and 
likely had been doing so for several days but the rut in 
all probability did not begin in earnest till about the 
22nd of the month. Local reports indicate that the rut 
in the area is past its height by October 10-tb though

the younger cows may continue to come into heat as late as 
October 20, Two cows noted on the lake flats on October 
7 were without consorting bulls and this seems to bear 
out the idea of the rut being on the decline by that time. 
Undoubtedly variations in the weather from year to year 
would cause a slight shift in the rutting period. 

Following the rut, in late October, it is reported that 
the moose will occasionally congregate in mixed groups. 

The calling of moose during the rut and the fighting 
of bulls, as described by so many authors, were not noted 
during the course of the survey though a mature bull shot 
at the height of the rut bore numerous fresh scars from 
a recent skirmish. It Is interesting to note that there 
are only two or three records of locked antlers being 
found in the Reserve. Notes on the polygamous status of 
the moose are discussed in the section on reproduction. 

Particular interest was taken in the rutting wallows 
and other pawings which the bulls indulge in at breeding 
time. From the locations of these it became apparent 
that most of the mating activities were carried on either 
in the sheltered, willowgrown areas of abandoned stream 
beds or at higher altitudes at the heads of favorable 
draws. It was also noted that the pawings were of two 
types. The first and most common type consisted of a

shallow bowl-shaped depression varying from 1-g- to 3 feet 
in diameter (see fig. 13)« These smelled strongly of 
urine and showed evidence of having been rolled in. It 
would appear that the practice of pawing up wallows, 
urinating and rolling in them, as described by Hosley 
(1949), is part of the premating activities of the animals. 
The second type of pawing depression is entirely different 
and, if local reports can be relied upon, is likely 
involved in the actual mating. These depressions are 
about 6-8 inches deep and 15-18 inches across with quite 
steep sides. According to local trappers bulls have been 
seen to paw out these depressions, whereupon the cow 
places her hind feet in them thus lowering her hind¬ 
quarters and facilitating the copulatory process which 
usually follows immediately. Such a freshly dug depression 
was found when a bull and cow were disturbed during the 
height of the rutting period and several older ones were 
observed from time to time during the summer. 

In general the breeding studies were rather 
disappointing and the poor results can likely be attri¬ 
buted to a combination of two factors. Firstly, the 
open, warm fall encouraged the animals to range further 
and higher rather than to move down towards the lake 
flats. Secondly, the shooting of the three moose during 
September for anatomical study is believed to have

GENERAL APPEARANCE' ANT) PELAGE 

The moose is the largest, most ungainly looking of 
the deer family. The bulls may stand 6 feet high at the 
shoulder and measure 8-9 feet in length. The largest of 
the Alaska moose may weigh 1700-1800 pounds (Gamp, 1948)® 
The cows are generally about three quarters the size of 
the bulls. 

The bulls are most distinctive with their huge sets 
of palmated antlers which are grown each year and shed 
after the breeding season. The exceedingly long head 
with its characteristic pendulous upper lip is borne on 
a short, thick muscular neck. Prom the high shoulders 
the animalte back slopes down to lower hindquarters. 

The tail is a short insignificant stub which is unnoticable 
to the casual observer. The long, ungainly-looking legs 
serve the creatures admirably for negotiating the boggy 
and brushy habitat which they frequent. The track of the 
moose is easily distinguished by the pointedness of the 
cloven hooves and the large size (up to 7 M for bulls). 

A distinctive feature is the bell or dewlap - a 
pendulous bag of skin which hangs from the neck at the 
base of the head. This is fairly long in young animals 
but decreases in size as the animal ages. A three year 
old bull shot at Rock Lake bore a bell 10 inches long.

The pelage of the moose, most commonly described as 
dark brown to brownish black, can be most variable* A 
buckskin female and males varying from medium brown to 
nearly black were noted just prior to the rut. The 
winter pelage which is quite dark usually becomes faded 
and greyish by the time of shedding in May or June 
(Peterson, 1949). It was noted that the greying was 
pronounced along the short mane of the neck and along 
the belly. The legs below the knee are greyish and on 
the inner portions of the hind legs above the knees a 
definite white area usually occurs which is particularly 
noticable when the animal is in motion* A reasonably 
accurate criterion for judging the sex of the animal 
when the antlers of the bulls have been shed seems to be 
the lighter brown face of the female. 

The calves are born with a reddish brown coat which 
may be faded to nearly a fawn color by July. Peterson, 
(1949) states that the juvenile coat Is shed after 2-3 
months and the new coat is greyish brown, lighter beneath 
and the face is brown. Calves noted in September ranged 
from this greyish brown color to a blackish brown nearly 
comparable to the adult.

GENERAL BEHAVIOUR AND ACTIVITIES 

Senses 

Peterson (1949) considers that hearing serves to 
alert the moose, sight to investigate and smell to provide 
the stimulus for action. On the basis of certain observ- 
-ations made in 1952 it would appear that eyesight may be of 
more importance than previously considered. On one 
occasion a cow and calf were disturbed by my movements 
on a hillside nearly three quarters of a mile across a 
flat. A strong crosswind sweeping down the valley 
minimized the chances of smell or sound reaching them so 
it must be assumed that the sight of my movements 
stimulated their flight. At times it seemed that smell 
provided no stimulus whatsoever since shifting by the 
observer to a position upwind from the animal resulted 
in no change in its behaviour. Evidently the reaction 
to stimulus depends on the animal’s alertness. It was 
noted that the animals kept the wind to their rear while 
feeding. This fact was also noted by Skunke ( 1949 ). 

Movements 

The moose is not a wandering animal and its movements, 
whether daily or seasonal, are not inclined to be great. 
Seton (1929) considers that a cow moose spends her life 
within 10 miles of her birthplace.

Daily movements are usually short shifts between 
the browsing area and adequate cover. Often the animals 
bed down right where they were feeding. The bulk of the 
activity of the moose at Hock Lake occurred in the 
evening after five p.m. and in the early morning before 
8 a,m,. However, a definite daytime feeding period was 
noted during the time aquatic vegetation was being 
utilized. This extended from 9:30 to 11 a.nu and 
continued until early July when feeding on aquatics in 
the shallow waters of the sloughs and bays ceased, 

Skunke (1949) considers that movement is less on windy 
days or in bad weather. This was substantiated by personal 
observations though it was noted that feeding often 
extended through most of the morning on cool cloudy days. 

It was also noted that activity increased at the licks 
following a prolonged period of bad weather and that it 
continued throughout the day. The longest single movement 
of a moose observed was a two mile trip by a bull to a 
salt lick. The swimming ability of moose is well known 
but at no time during the survey were the animals seen 
swimming in Rock Lake, Local residents reported seeing 
them swim the width of the lake on several occasions. 
Seasonal movements in the study area consisted of 
generalized shifts to the higher ridges in the summer 
months and downward movements into the sheltered valleys

in the winter. During the course of the survey fresh 
tracks were found on the highest windswept ridges above 
timberline and at the same time shed antlers and winter 
pellets found in the same locations indicated that, under 
certain conditions the animals do not entirely forsake 
these higher areas in the winter. It is quite likely 
that during mild spells or in a winter of little snow the 
animals range upward in search of fir browse. There was 
no evidence to indicate the occunsnce of lengthy 
migrations between summer and winter ranges as described 
by Hatter (1946), 


Social Habits 

The moose is not a gregarious animal and as a 
general rule lives in a solitary state. Loose aggregations 
may occur accidently at licks or in areas of excellent feed 
but these seem to be of little significance. The largest 
number of animals seen at a lick at one time was four bulls. 
Yarding of moose in the winter time seems to be quite 
variable according to most authors and generally doesn f t 
occur unless conditions become severe. There were no 
reports from, local residents of any yarding occurring In 
the Rock Ls.ke area. Since the valley is in a light snow 
region (average 2-3 feet) it is unlikely that yarding 
would normally occur.

Reactions to Humans 

It would seem that past experience is the major 
factor in determining the reaction of the animals to the 
presence of humans (Peterson, 1949). The moose in the 
Rock Lake area had not been hunted for two years and were 
therefore considerably more approachable than they would 
be now since the season has been opened. Cows with young 
calves would invariably depart In a hurry though it was 
possible to approach cows and their calves in the fall 
with little difficulty. In such cases the calf invariably 
proved to be the most nervous and would frequently trot 
off in alarm while the cow followed leisurely after 
(see fig. 15). 

Bulls generally seemed less tolerant of humans than 
the cows and would beat a steady and not always dignified 
retreat when aroused.. One particularly vigorous Individual 
when disturbed during the rut departed with the air of 
one nursing a very bad haacfache but at no time did he or 
any other rutting bull show signs of belligerence. Where 
the two sexes were found consorting during the mating 
season the cows were noted to be much more nervous than 
the bulls in the presence of humans. 

On several occasions I found it quite easy to approach 
dry cows and to follow them about without them becoming 
alarmed. The only sign of annoyance displayed at such

times was a flattening of the ears when one approached 
within 15-20 yards. Under these circumstances an 
immediate withdrawal was usually deemed advisable. In 
one particular instance no amount of shouting, whistling 
or waving of hats at a distance of thirty yards could 
interrupt the female in her feeding activities (see 
fig. 16.). 

In general I found the moose to be a rather curious 
animal and even In cases where they were obviously alarmed 
they would Invariably stop their flight one or more times 
to look back. When I speak of flight I refer to their 
loping trot for at no time did I ever see a moose in full 
panicky flight. Around the salt licks I found the moose 
to be rather persistent in their desire to get their 
salt requirements even in the presence of human intruders.

HABITAT STUDIES 

Peterson (1949) states that mixed stands of young 
second growth vegetation are essential in the formation 
of ideal moose habitat. Such areas usually develop as 
a result of fire or lumbering. 

In this respect the Rock Lake area is a perfect 
example of good moose habitat. In the natural state the 
valley bottoms are mixture of grassy meadow, willow 
pasture and poplar or spruce bluffs. Many of the south 
and west facing slopes are covered with bluffs of scrub 
poplar and scattered willow - perfect moose browse. This 
varied vegetational pattern extends up many of the narrow 
draws as well and all creek banks have their good stands 
of willow. The shaded slopes, of course, are covered with 
pine, spruce and fir and are therefore lost as moose 
habitat. 

The last major fire to go through the area occurred 
in 1931 and burnt off large areas around the lake. At 
present these tracts support small pines, aspen, willows 
and buffaloberry - all of which form excellent moose 
forage. However, on the basis of studies made on older 
burns the regeneration within the next twenty years will 
eliminate the useful browse now growing there. Thus, 
barring future fires, the quality of large tracts of

useable moose range In the area will decrease steadily 
and the carrying capacity will be appeciably reduced. 

The logical solution to this appears to be controlled 
burning of selected areas at periodic intervals. The 
loss in timber values to the country would be negligible 
when one considers the extremely slow rate of regrowth 
of merchantable timber in higher alpine regions. 

The presence of logging interests in the valley 
below the lake is bound to have a certain effect on the 
moose range. Some 5,720 acres on the Wildhay River and 
its tributaries have been or are being logged. As the 
timber is all overmature spruce a practice of clear 
cutting has been followed and generally the areas logged 
over were completely denuded. Operations began in 1946 
and studies made in the area cut then show no appreciable 
development of useable browse species over the intervening 
six years. Herbaceous species occur in abundance but they 
have value only as summer foods. Undoubtedly the logging 
operations will prove beneficial to the moose over a long 
period of time but it will be some time yet before the 
cut-over areas will support vegetation enough to make 
them suitable as wintering grounds. The 5000 or 6000 acres 
logged are only a very minor portion of the area and 
as they had been lost to the moose as feeding grounds 
anyway I can forsee no detrimental effect to the wildlife

arising from them. The present status of the timber in 
the area is such that it is extremely unlikely that 
further extensive logging operations will be carried 
out in the vicinity of Rock Lake in the immediate future. 



Pig. 19. Area on south fork logged 
in 1946. Heavy herbaceous growth

Aquatic feeding possibilities are not as extensive 
as in eastern Canada but Rock Lake and the sloughs at 
its upper end provide considerable pondweed ( Potamogeton ) 
and mare 1 s tail ( Hippuris ) for the moose during the summer 
months. Unfortunately four other small sloughs in the 
general vicinity have developed no appreciable aquatic 
growth and are therefore of no value as feeding grounds. 


















58 


FOOD STUDIES 

The food requirements of an animal constitute a 
very vital phase of its ecology and therefore considerable 
time and effort was devoted to an attempt to determine 
the plants utilized by the moose in the area and their 
relative importance. Summer foods were determined in 
part through observation and vegetational analysis and 
partly through examination of stomach contents of three 
animals shot on special permit. Winter feeding habits 
were determined through sample plot studies and pellet 
analyses. 

Feeding Habits 

Considerable time was spent during the summer 
observing the moose during their feeding periods in an 
effort to gain as much information about their eating 
habits as possible. Aquatic feeding was given particular 
consideration and several interesting facts were noted* 
Activity in the early part of the season was confined to 
one shallow bay of the lake and several adjoining sloughs 
in which the vegetation developed earliest. It was noted 
that the vegetation fed upon was almost entirely Hippur-js 
vulgaris (mare's tail). Undoubtedly some Potamogeton 
(pondweed) was also taken. Waterlily ( Nvmphaea ). a

favored food in some parts was totally absent from the 
area. 



Fig. 20. Mare 1 s tail ( Hlppuras ) torn 
up by the moose during their feeding. 

Aquatic feeding ceased about July 3rd and this was 
attributed to the increasing unpalatability of the plants 
as they matured. It was noted that feeding ceased just 
about the time the flowering stalks of the plants 
appeared above water and no further feeding occurred in 
these areas. Although moose are generally considered to 
feed in the early morning and evening hours it was noted 
that a definite midmorning feeding period from 9 to 11 
a.m. existed until about the first of July when it ceased 
at the same time as the aquatic feeding. Aquatic feeding

was resumed about the middle of August along the lake 
shore and was still continuing when the survey terminated 
in October. However, feeding during late summer and fall 
was confined to the shores of the lake in somewhat deeper 
water than earlier in the season. However, at no time 
was a moose seen more than bellydeep in the water. 
Investigation of the plants in the areas frequented by the 
moose showed them to be chiefly Hippurls and Potamogeton , 
as in the shallower waters. 

Observations with respect to summer browsing habits 
proved that, although some twigs were taken, the bulk 
of the feeding consisted of stripping the leaves of aspen 
poplar and willow off the branches by taking them cross¬ 
wise in the mouth and jerking the head upward. Subsequent 
investigation revealed that, as a general rule, this 
feeding practice did little harm to the branches themselves 
and young buds were left intact. In all cases feeding was 
noted to be random i.e. the animals would feed here and 
there without browsing one single bush completely. 

Examination of the browse plots discussed in the 
next section showed that fresh summer browsing occurred 
on willow in 31 plots, on aspen poplar in 4, on balsam 
poplar in 9, on bog birch in 2 and on buffaloberry and 
green alder in one each. Some utilization of the 
herbaceous plants, fireweed ( Bnilobium ) and peavine 






61 


( Lathvrus ) was also noted. These browse figures are, 

I think, indicative of the importance of willow and 
poplar as summer browse. 

Stripping of bark from willows and aspen poplar 
apparently occurs in the spring as the sap is rising 
and several such instances were observed. One remarkable 
case is shown below. The exact reason for this barking 
is not too clear but likely the bark acts as some sort 
of a spring tonic. Salicin, a chemical found in willow 
and poplar bark, is known to have just such a tonic action. 



Fig. 21. Aspens barked by moose in 
May 1951, This case is unique because 
the bark had been jerked off in large 

strips (some four feet long) and eaten 
uo entirely. 









62 


Stomach Analyses 

Two quart samples of the stomach contents from 
each of three animals shot during September were washed 
and dried for analysis during the winter. In all cases 
the animals were shot toward the end of their morning 
feeding periods and, with the exception of the mature 
bull, the material in the stomach was largely intact and 
quite decipherable. The mature bull was taken during the 
rut and, as might be expected, had little food in the 
paunch and what there was was quite watery* 

In addition to the three fresh samples of stomach 
contents one sample from an animal killed the previous 
winter was collected. 

The first sample from a cow shot on September 5 
weighed 127 grams dry weight and was found to consist 
of roughly 75^ aspen poplar leaves, 20 % willow leaves 
and five percent small twigs. There were slight traces 
of peavine ( Lathyrus ) and bedstraw ( Gallium borealfe jo 

The sample from the 5 year old bull shot on September 
18 weighed 205 grams and consisted mainly of willow leaves. 
Twigs amounted to 7 % of the dry weight of the sample and 
small amounts of bedstraw, peavine, grass and sedge, 
buffaloberry ( Shepherdia ) and rushes were present. The 


animal had been feeding in the lake shallows just prior

to being shot but no indications of aquatic species other 
than sedges and rushes were found in the sample. 

A sample weighing 130 grams was collected from the 
paunch of the mature bull shot at the height of the rut 
on October 1st. The remarkable fact about the sample 
is that it was almost 100$ graminaceous materialJ Very 
small traces of willow, fir needles and lungwort 

( Mertensia ) were noted. At least part of the graminaceous matter 
was known to be rye grass ( Elymus ). One possible 
explanation for this unusual feeding behaviour could be 
that during periods of physiological disturbance when 
digestion is upset the bulls will seek the more easily 
digested food materials. 

The stomach sample from the animal killed during the 
winter was found to contain principally twigs from yellow 
barked willows, some 5-10$ graminaceous material and 
traces of fir needles. 

Although the set of samples was too small to be 
significant I think one may justifiably consider that 
the diet of the moose during the summer and early fall 
consists principally of aspen and willow leaves with 
aquatic species and graminaceous material playing a 
secondary role.

Plot Studies 

The assessment of winter browsing values was achieved 
through use of a system of sample plot analysis developed 
by Aldous (1948) and used by Peterson (1949) in his moose 
studies* Certain modifications were made in the original 
method but basically it remained the same. l/lOQ acre 
plots (a circle with an 11*7 ft* radius) were laid out on 
compass-plotted transects at 100 yard intervals (paced)* 
Various browse species within the plot were noted. 

Percent of the plot covered by each species and the percent 
of available browse on each species which had been utilized 
by moose were estimated and recorded. Aldous determined 
the occurrence of browse species and degree of browsing in 
terms of light, medium or heavy and then assigned 
arbitrary percentage figures to each category* During 
the 1952 studies an effort was made to estimate the actual 
percentage values for each individual plot. Four hundred 
and eighty five plots were laid out in June and early 
July, This was a bit late in the season for best results 
as new growth was obscuring the effects of winter browsing 
but fairly accurate results were obtained. 

The entire flat below Rock Lake was chequered with 
plots taken every hundred yards on NW-SE transects which 
were spaced 100 yards apart. In addition, separate 
transects were made on the upper Rock Lake flats and

on various mountain slopes in an attempt to sample as 
many of the vegetational types as possible. Since there 
is considerable logging in the Wildhay River valley plots 
were taken in cutover areas of various ages in an attempt 
to ascertain what regrowth of suitable moose food could 
be expected. The transects, with the exception of those 
in the logged-over areas, are plotted on fig, 11 , page 51.

The results of the plot analyses are summarized

of the six columns is given on the following page. 






66 


EXPLANATION OP COLUMNS IN BROWSE PLOT TABLE 


Column 1 - % of plots present - This is obtained 
by totalling the number of plots in 
which each species occurred and dividing 
this by the total number of plots 
analysed. 

Column 2 - Average density - This figure is obtained 
by adding up the total density figures 
for each species and dividing by the 
number of plots surveyed. 

Column 5 - Average degree of browsing - column 3 

is obtained in a similar manner as column 
2 except the degree of browsing figures 
are totalled and divided by the number 
of plots in which each species occurred. 

Column 4 - After columns 2&3 are completed for 
each species, the average density is 
multiplied by the average degree of 
browsing to obtain this column of values 
which represents usage. This column in 
itself is of little significance until 
its values are transposed to a percentage 
basis in the next column. 


Column 5 - This column of figures is obtained by 
dividing the total of all usage values 
(Column 4) into the usage values of each 
species. These figures then represent 
the percent of total foods eaten by the 
moose that each species has provided. 

Column 6 - Percent of browse available - to 

represent the percent of total browse 
that each species provides the total of 
all average densities (column 2) is 
divided into each species’ average 
density.

Several points of considerable interest were noted 
as a result of the plot studies. The relative paucity 
of browse species in the study area was particularly 
striking, Peterson (1949) found 29 browse species in 
Ontario, of which 25 had been utilized and 12 of which 
formed 92.3$ of all food eaten. Only 19 species were 
found in the Rock Lake area. Sixteen of them had been 
browsed to some extent and 3 species provided 94,6$ of 
the total food eaten. Conspicuous by their absence from 
the area were such important moose food species as 
mountain ash ( Sorbus americana ), Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga 
taxifoil a ), paper birch ( Betula papyrifera ), and maples 
( Acer spp, ). Hazelnut ( Corylus cornuta ), High bush 
cranberry ( Viburnum opulus ), shadbush ( Amelanchler sp.) 
and red osier dogwood ( Cornus stolonifera ), though 
possibly of limited occurrence in the area, were not found 
in any of the plots studied. 

Plots taken in logged-over areas revealed that, even 
after a lapse of five or six years no appreciable browse 
had developed. Summer foods such as peavine and grass 
were very abundant but winter foods were practically 
nonexistent thus making the year-round use of these areas 
impossible. 

The status of the conifers as moose food was of 
special interest in view of the abundance of Xodgepole 
P^ ne ( Pinus contorts ), and relatively small amounts of

alpine fir ( Abies lasiocarpa ) which were available for 
winter browsing. Pine was found to rank second in 
percent of food eaten while fir ranked seventh. This 
is in direct contrast to the situation in Ontario where 
Peterson (1949) considered balsam fir to be the most 
commonly eaten winter food and vital in the winter 
economy of moose. Martin (1951) considered fir to 
constitute of the winter diet and pine 1# to 2%, 

The ten most important winter browse species in 
the Rock Lake area, on a percentage basis of food eaten, 
are ranked as follows: (1) willow, (2) lodgepole pine, 
(3) aspen poplar, (4) buffaloberry, (5) green alder, 

(6) balsam, poplar, (7) alpine fir, (8) bog birch, 

(9) rhododendron, (10) gooseberry. 

As indicated by the average degree of browsing the 
ten most highly preferred winter foods were found to be 
in the following order: (1) willow, (2) aspen poplar, 

(3) balsam poplar, (4) alpine fir, (5) rhododendron, 

(6) green alder, (7) bog birch, (8) lodgepole pine, 

(9) currant, (10) juniper. 

The reasonably large percentage of lodgepole pine 
taken seems to be related to its extreme abundance rather 
than to any great degree of palatability. The use of 

rhododendron, with its apparent high palatability, is 
curtailed by its limited occurrence in the area.

It was of considerable interest to note the marked 
preferences of the moose for certain species of willow. 

The more succulent yellow-barked willow ( Salix maocalliana ) 
appeared to be the favorite, the red-barked S>. arbusculoides 
ranked next while the coarser and more woody grey barked 
S. glauca was utilized but slightly. In several cases 
maoeal liana was noted to be browsed as high as S0% while 
adjacent bushes of glanca were untouched. Future study 
of this problem may reveal many interesting factors about 
relative palatability of closely related species. 

Skunke (1949) considers spruce as an emergency moose 
food. Since there was no indication of any utilization 
of spruce around Rock Lake it may be assumed that the 
moose have been living well within the bounds of their 
food supply and have not had to resort to use of the 
emergency food species. 

No instances of appreciable overbrowsing were noted 
in the area. Moose have a habit of straddling small 
trees and breaking them down to secure the upper foliage 
but few cases of this were observed during the course of 
the studies. However, the condition of much of the willow 
growth indicated that severe overbrowsing occurred some 
years ago.(see fig. 23)* 

Peterson (1949) considered that the presence of 
deer and elk in any numbers within areas frequented by

moose largely nullified the value of browse plot studies. 
Therefore, since both animals occur in the Rock Lake area 
the results obtained from the browse analyses must be 
considered somewhat inaccurate. Cowan (1945) considered 
willow highly palatable to black-tailed deer in summer 
but made no mention of it being browsed in winter. 

Therefore it is possible that the deer will not appreciably 
alter the winter browse figures on willow. Murie (1951) 
considered bog birch, aspen and willow the most favored 
browse species of elk in the mountain areas. Hence it 
is likely that the elk constitute the major factor in 
altering the true moose browse picture. In view of the 
relatively small numbers of both deer and elk In the area 
I do not feel that the data on moose browsing will be 
basically altered. 

A number of plots were studied within the pasture at 
the Rock Lake Ranger Station in an attempt to determine 
the effect of fencing on moose movements. On the basis 
of the browse analyses and personal observation it appeared 
that a four foot fence, when topped by rails, provided 
no obstacle to the moose. However, it has been reported 
that the moose persistently blunder into wire fences which 
do not have a rail along the top. This appears to be the 

result of the animal’s inability to recognize the fine 
wires as a barrier.

Pellet Analyses 

Moose faeces, in summer, are viscous mass«due to 
the increased percentage of herbaceous material in the 
diet. With the onset of fall and the switch to a more 
woody diet the faeces become more consolidated and 
assume the shape of small elongated pellets roughly 
one inch in length. It would appear that pellet 
formation begins in September and ends in early June. 

The pellets have been found to contain many identifiable 
portions of woody plants and therefore may serve as 
another criterion upon which to base an adequate study of 
winter moose diet. 

In the course of the above-mentioned plot studies 
200 samples (5 pellets each) of winter pellets were 
collected for analysis* Two pellets from each sample 
were broken up with a mortar and pestle and were placed 
under a binocular microscope for study. In most cases 
it was found that portions of pine and fir needles, 
graminaceous material and willow twigs were readily 
identifiable under magnification. The results of the 
study are as follows: twigs in 100$ of the samples, pine 
in 45,5$, fir in 19$, and graminaceous material in 85.5$ 
of the samples. With few exceptions the percent of pine, 
fir and graminaceous material in each sample was found to 
be very small - generally less than 10$. From the above

form a consistent, though small, portion of the winter 
diet of the moose. Fir on the other hand appears to be 
of relatively minor importance.

SAT,* LICK STUDIES 

Natural salt licks have long been an object of much 
interest to naturalists and even yet there is a great 
deal of uncertainty as to the actual value and importance 
of these much-frequented areas. Almost without exception 
the salt content of the soil and water has been found to 
be extremely low. However, the very fact that the animals 
persistently come to these spots indicates that there must 
be some element present which their bodies require. A 
series of studies begun in 1951 was expanded in 1952 in 
an effort to gain some idea of the compounds present 
which the moose seem to require. 

A total of twelve licks in the general Rock Lake 
area were investigated and, of these, eleven were found 
within a five mile radius of the lake. The twelfth was 
located near Eagles Nest Fass thirteen miles from the 
lake. Five of the licks had areas of over 2000 square 
yards and could be considered of major importance while 
the rest were much smaller. Location of the licks 
appeared to follow no definite pattern - some occurred 
on river flats, others on boggy hillsides, still others 
at the bases of hillsides and three were found on or near 
the divides between creeks.

hillside. Note trails leading 
down to it from all angles. 

Soil Analyses 

A series of three soil samples were taken from each 
lick - sample A from the surface soil in the lick; 
sample B taken from 12-18" deep in the lick; and sample 
G from a 6” depth 20 yards back from the edge of the 
lick. It was felt that these three samples would give 
a fairly accurate picture of the occurrence of the salt 
concentrations. 

The Soils Department at the University of Alberta 
carried out analyses on the soluble salt content of the 
soil samples and the resulting data are presented in 
table 6 on the following page.

Note: No carbonate present in samples

With the exception of licks 3, 4 and 10 which 
contained much sulphur the soil of the licks was slightly 
alkaline. This fact becomes more significant when one 
notes that with but two exceptions the soil around the 
licks was slightly acid. This indicates that the licks 
contain accumulations of alkaline salts. Aside from two 
of the sulphur licks the total soluble salt content of 
the samples never exceeded 9 b% to .75$* Except for 
sodium which generally was most abundant in the surface 
soil of the licks no consistent correlation in the 
location of maximum abundance of the various salts could 
be determined. The amount of sodium present showed a 
rough correlation to the size of the lick but one or two 
notable exceptions where large licks were lacking in this 
element tend to make this invalid. It is rather interest-™ 
-ing that chloride was almost universally absent from the 
samples. In all likelihood this is due to its extreme 
solubility which has resulted in it being leached from 
the soil. 

The only significant points which seem to arise from 
the soil analyses are the general alkalinity of the lick 
soil and the relative abundance of sodium in the surface 
soil. This correlation indicates that in all likelihood 
sodium is responsible for much of the alkalinity of the 
licks and therefore may be one of the constituents 
attracting the animals.

Water Analyses 

Water samples (24 fl. ozs. ) were taken from the pools 
or seepages in the licks in an attempt to determine 
whether the salts present actually existed in the local 
soil or were brought in in the seepage flow. This is of 
particular interest in view of the fact that, while deer 
and sheep will eat the soil at the licks, moose seem to 
confine their activities to sipping the water lying about 
in the licks. As a matter of general interest, and for 
comparison, samples were also obtained from a sulphur 
spring which was not utilized as a lick and from the Hay 
River* 

Analyses on the samples were carried out by Mr, J* 

A, Kelso, provincial analyst and his findings are 
contained in table 7 on the next page* 

Analysis of the water samples, as with the soils, 
revealed little in the way of correlation between amount 
of usage and the amount of salts present or the degree 
of alkalinity. In general, the better patronized licks 
were those containing NaHCO^ as one of the alkaline 
components. It was also noted that in the cases of the 
unutilized sulphur spring and one very poorly defined 
sulphur lick the sulphate concentration was at both places 
over 900 parts per million. It seems logical therefore 
that a very high concentration of sulphate may be

unpalatable to the animals. 

At this point I would like to make mention of certain 
observations made by Stan Clark, a longtime resident of 
the area, concerning sulphur licks. Over the years he 
has noted that moose frequenting areas rich in sulphur 
springs were found to be free of ticks. He advanced the 
hypothesis that perhaps the sulphides or some other agents 
in the water found their way to the epidermal tissues 
after the animal had consumed them. Conceivably then, 
these agents may have exerted a repellent effect upon 
the ticks. There is little concrete evidence to support 
this theory but I do feel that it is certainly worthy of 
further study. The fact that a rubbing tree (alpine fir) 
used by moose was found within 20 feet of a sulphur lick 
may or may not be of significance.

Salting Experiments 

One of the major licks at the head of the Rock Creek 
flats was selected as the location for a series of 
salting experiments designed to determine, if possible, 
the salt preferences of moose* The experiments carried 
out were based on information received from the Idaho 
Department of Fish & Game and the Montana Cooperative 
Wildlife Research Unit concerning big game salting 
experiments carried out in those states. 

After rather lengthy delays in obtaining the desired 
chemicals, a dual set of experiments were set up at the 
lick on July 26 and were carried on until the survey 
terminated in October, The nineteen chemicals used were 
as follows: CoClg, HgS0 4 , H 3 P0 4 , HI, KHC0 3 , CuS0 4 , NaHC0 3 
FeS0 4 , Na 3 P0 4 , CaClg, MgClg, NaCl, NH 4 I, KHgP0 4 , CaC0 3 , 
Cal, Nal, KC1, KI. 

The first experiment consisted of dissolving as much 
of each salt as possible (up to -J- pound) in three pints 
of water and mixing It with seven pounds of sandy loam. 
These muddy mixtures were then placed in small troughs 
measuring 8 ,! x 14 ,f x 5 M which were hollowed from logs and 
placed in the center of the lick area (see figs. 28 - 30). 

Realizing that the animals would be rather cautious 
about any strange object at the lick it was decided to 
run a parallel experiment under as nearly natural conditio:

as possible. A series of bowlshaped depressions 18 n 
across and 6” deep were dug along the higher elevations 
of the lick. Into each of these three pints of salt 
solution (three pints of water saturated with salt - ■§■ 
pound maximum) were poured and then the depressions were 
filled with water (see fig. 31). The depressions and 
troughs in both experiments were checked for usage and 
refilled with water at weekly intervals during the summer 
while fresh salt solutions were added monthly to restore 
loss by leaching. 

Results of the trough experiments were largely 
negative and it was felt that at least a year would be 
required before game would be sufficiently used to the 
troughs to make use of them. However, it was noted that 
stray outfitter*s horses made ready use of the salt 
troughs and particularly the one containing NaGl. A 
study of the salt impregnated depressions revealed that 
the moose showed particular interest in Na^PO^ and NaGl 
though the phosphate was the mart used of the two. These 
preferences agree closely with results obtained in 
similar experiments in the States (Cheatum, 1951). 

Results of the salting experiments and soil and water 
analyses all Indicate that the sodium ion is one of, if 
not the important, elements in natural salt licks.

General Lick Observations 

As a result of the summer»s activities several points 
of interest in the lick activities of moose were noted. 
First, it was observed that activity at the licks was 
greatest immediately following prolonged periods of bad 
weather and that at such times the animals would frequent 
the lick throughout the day. Ordinarily the largest 
proportion of activity at the licks is nocturnal. Second, 
activity of the moose at the lick was confined to sipping 
water - there was no eating of soil. Stance of the moose 
while drinking was usually one foreleg back and the other 
slightly bent. Peterson,(1949) describes three stances. 

At no time was a moose seen to kneel as has been reported 
by some local trappers. Third, young calves were observed 
to make use of the lick at two months of age. Fourth, in 
general, lick activity was maintained through the summer 
and into the fall with only moderate fluctuation. Where- 
ever lick activity declined with the advancing season it 
was noted that the decline seemed to be correlated with 
a drying up of the lick. Thus it appears that apparent 
seasonal fluctuations in the use of licks may be due, in 
part anyway, to the availability of the salts rather than 
entirely to variations in the animal f s metabolic require¬ 
ments as suggested by some investigators*

ANATOMICAL STUDIES 


During the period September 5 to October 1 three 
moose were shot on a special biological permit for 
anatomical study. These animals were as follows: a 
mature cow, a three year old bull and a mature bull. 
Originally it was hoped that obviously diseased animals 

could be taken for study but since all animals seen 
appeared to be in reasonably healthy condition three 
specimens were finally picked at random. Taking of the 
animals was delayed until September in order that some¬ 
what cooler weather could be used to advantage in the 
handling of meat from the carcasses. In accordance with 
the terms of the permit meat from all three animals was 
turned over to the local Forest Officer for distribution 
to charity. Mr. S. H. Clark gave me particularly valuable 
assistance in the butchering and transportation of the 
carcasses. 

An extensive study of all internal organs was carried 
out on all three animals and fresh specimens of heart, 
liver, lung, spleen, kidney, and intestine were secured. 

In addition sterile swabs of heart and liver blood were 
taken and blood smears were made from all organs. In 
each case the specimen material was dispatched within 
24 hours of collection to the Provincial Veterinary

Samples of the stomach contents of each animal were 
washed to remove digestive juices and then dried and 
packed for food analysis which was conducted during the 
winter at the University of Alberta.

DISEASES AND PARASITES 

Pathological investigation of tissues from the three 
animals shot failed to reveal any bacterial infections 
but parasitic tapeworms, either as adults or as cysts, 
occurred in all three. Hydatid cysts of Echinococcus 
granulosus occurred in the lungs of the cow and mature 
bull. Cysts of Cysticercus tenuico111s (intermediate 
stage of Taenia hydatigena ) were found in the heart, 
liver and back muscles of the three year old bull and 
in the liver of the mature bull. Adult tapeworms of a 
Mone 7 ,ia species were found in the ilea of the cow and 
young bull. Infestation in the case of the cow was very 
light, there being but a single worm present; but the 
ileum of the young bull was partially blocked by 7 or 8 
mature worms lying side by side. However, aside from 
being slightly thin the animal did not seem to be 
suffering any ill effects from this infestation. 

None of the animals examined carried any ticks 
( Dermfrcenter albinictus ) and at no time during the course 
of the survey were any picked up in the brush. The 
previous year (1951) a few ticks were collected involunt¬ 
arily from the brush around Rock Lake. The fact that 
horses coming in from winter range during the past two 
years have been relatively free of ticks seems to indicate

that tick infestations are at a low ebb at the present 
time. 

Local Indians reported that the die-off of moose 
in the area some ten or fifteen years ago was accompanied 
by a particularly heavy infestation of ticks. Strickland 
(1938) reported on tick infestations on moose in Elk 
Island Park during the die-off of the animals in 1938. 

He believed that the die-off was due directly or indirectly 
to the ticks but was unable to obtain positive tests which 
might indicate that the fatal moose disease,which ticks 
are reported to carry, was responsible for the deaths. 

Insect pests in the area are, I believe, of little 
real concern to the moose. Mosquitoes end the so-called 
bulldogs may become annoying in July and August but do 
not attain anywhere near the numbers common at lower 
elevations. If the flies do become too bothersome the 
moose have but to move out on the clear windswept ridges 
for complete relief.

PREDATION 

The effect of wolves upon the moose population is 
perhaps one of the most hotly disputed wildlife problems 
today* Cowan (1945) considered that the wolves in Jasper 
National Park had little effect on the overall moose 
population. However, every investigator, whether pro or 
con, admits that the wolves do prey on the moose to some 
extent and therefore these predators must be considered 
a factor in the control of the moose population. 

Predation during the past winter appeared to be 
quite light and of over 70 carcasses noted only 4 or 5 
could be classed as the previous winter*s kills. The 
patrolman stationed at Rock Lake during the winter reported 
that the wolves in the area were quite few and to the best 
of my knowledge only one pack of five or six animals 
ranged, through the area at periodic intervals during the 
summer. However, evidence that they were exacting a year- 
round toll on game was noted in the case of the cow moose 
shot on September 5. Presence of milk in the udder of the 
animal indicated a calf but none was seen at the time of 
shooting or during an intensive search of the area soon 
afterward. Further examination of the carcass revealed 
weekold scars, which could only be interpreted as fangmarks, 
on the tendon of the left hind leg and hence it may

logically be assumed that the calf fell prey to the 
wolves at the time the cow was attacked. The bull 
whose remains are shown in fig. 33 was presumed to have 
been killed by wolves since the surrounding underbrush 
was badly crushed and broken as though a battle had 
occurred at the time of it's demise. 

The close proximity of Jasper National Park presents 
a possible problem in predator control. Within the Park 
the wolves may breed with immunity and then range out 
over the surrounding area. As long as these predators 
have a protected breeding ground no programme of trapping 
or poisoning can be completely effective. At present I 
do not think this problem is critical but I do feel it is 
worthy of further investigation. Cowan (1945) considered 
the area between Hock Creek and the Snake Indian River 
(in Jasper Park) to be one of the main wintering grounds 
of the wolves in the northern part of the Park. Therefore 
any pressure exerted by the animals is bound to be 
directed to the Rock Lake area. 

Figure 34 of nineteen wolves poisoned out of a pack 
of twenty in the winter of 1950-51 shows rather well the 
color variation among wolves and indicates the size of 
packs which may range through the Reserve. 

Most investigators (Hosley, 1949) are agreed that 
bears constitute a measurable factor in moose mortality*

particularly where their numbers are large. Black bears 
prey principally on the young calves and likely have little 
direct effect on the adult population. Grizzlies, on the 
other hand, are fully capable of downing fullgrown animals. 
During the summer of 1951 two cases of grizzlies killing 
moose were reported to me. The first incident occurred 
on the banks of the Wildhay River and was witnessed by 
two Indians. The bear was seen to pummel the calf to 
death and devour it while the cow stood off in the brush 
bawling. In the second case two fishermen observed a 
grizzly on the Muskeg River feeding on a fullgrown bull 
which had been killed just a few hours previously. Stan 
Clark also reported seeing a grizzly pursuing a cow and 
calf two or three years previously. Cowan (1947) reported 
that grizzlies commonly ran down elk and moose. In 1952 
one report of a badly mauled cow moose was received and 
was investigated without success. As the bear population 
(both black and grizzly) in the Rock Lake area appears 
to be relatively small I do not think that these predators 
exert any serious effect on the moose population. 

In all likelihood cougars are capable of killing 
moose but as these animals are reported to be rather 
uncommon in the area they may be disregarded as a factor 
in predation.

Coyotes are generally regarded (Hosley, 1949) as 
ineffective in killing moose. It is quite possible that 
they may pull down the occasional young calf which may 
have strayed from its mother but it is unlikely that they 
would face a grown animal in healthy condition. Most of 
the moose remains found in coyote scats are undoubtedly 
from carrion for the animals are great scavengers. 

Insofar as they may protect the moose food supply by 
keeping the rabbit population down coyotes may be considered 
of some benefit to the moose. The coyote population around 
Rock Lake appears to be within normal bounds and several 
animals were destroyed during the course of predator 
control activities last winter.

RELATIONSHIPS TO OTHER ANIMALS 

Elk 

Elk are generally considered to be the most aggressive 
of the deer family and where competition with other related 
species developes they invariably become the dominant 
animals. Cowan (1945) considers that the relatively low 
moose population in Jasper National Park may be due, in 
part at least, to competition with the elk for the food 
supply on a greatly overpopulated range. Murie (1951) 
considered that the pressure exerted on the food supply 
by elk is greater because they congregate in such large 
numbers. 

On the basis of personal observations made in 1951 
it would seem that the moose have some actual aversion 
to contact with the elk. While observing five bull elk 
feeding and resting on an open hillside the writer noted 
a bull moose moving uphill toward the elk. At a distance 
of 200-300 yards he apparently caught wind of them and 
stopped in his tracks. He then whirled about and trotted 
rapidly over the ridge at right angles to his original 
course. 

According to local reports It is only within recent 
years that elk have appeared in the Rock Lake area from 
Jasper National Park. At present their numbers are not

large and seven animals were the most ever seen together 
at one time. The fact that no bugling was heard during 
the rutting season indicates that there is not much 

breeding occurring in the area. 

Competition in the summer when abundant graze is 
available for the elk may be considered to be negligible. 
Severe winter conditions as experienced in 1951-?52 when 
a rain and thaw in midwinter iced over the entire area, 
may make the graze inaccessible to elk. Under these 
circumstances the feeding pressure will be thrown entirely 
on browse species which the moose also utilize (see page 
71). However, in view of the relatively small elk 
population I do not believe that they exert an appreciable 
competitive effect on the moose. 

Peer 

On the basis of animals seen and the utilization of 
licks I do not feel that the deer population around Rock 
Lake is large enough to produce a significant effect on 
the available browse supply even under the drastic winter 
conditions described in the above section on elk. From 
observations made at salt licks it appears that the moose 
and deer are quite compatible when in contact with one 


another

Caribou 

Mountain caribou once ranged right across the Rock 
Lake area in fair numbers but now only the odd animal 
drifts through the district in the winter. Small bands 
still occur to the north around the headwaters of the 
Wildhay River. Their effect on moose range can therefore 
be considered practically nil. 

Domestic Stock 

In the past the presence of outfitter's horses in the 
area has been rather sporadic as the region has never been 
highly rated as a wintering range. At present one small 
band of horses is being wintered at Rock Lake but their 
effect on the overall food supply will likely be negligible. 
There is no indication that the numbers of stock being 
grazed there will be increased in the near future, 

Beaver 

Peterson (1949) considered the beaver to exert 
considerable effect on moose habitat through their pond 
building practises. He felt that the nem' plant successions 
set up by their actions outweigh any loss of habitat or 
food supply (poplar). The beaver population in the Rock 
Lake area is not large and with one exception the animals 
are all bank dwellers. Therefore there is no altering of

habitat through pond development. The utilization of 
browse along the streams is not enough to reduce the 
available beaver food appreciably and the moose certainly 
have ample browse available which is out of reach of the 
beaver. In the light of these facts one may assume that 
the effect of beaver and moose upon each other is 
negligabie in the Rock Lake area. 

Rabbits 

When the rabbits reach the peaks of their cycle it 
is quite possible that they might exert an adverse effect 
on the moose food supply through their habit of barking 
willow and other browse species. In extreme instances 
they may bring about a periodic plant kill of many of the 
browse plants. However, the rabbits In the Rock Lake 
area have never recovered their numbers since the cyclic 
"crash" in the twenties and at present are not overly 
abundant in the region even though the cycle is once more 
on the upswing. Most of the barking which was noted in 
the area occurred in young stands of lodgepole pine. Ho 
appreciable barking was ever noted on the willows. Thus, 
at the present time, rabbits can be disregarded as a factor 
of any consequence in the moose ecology of the area.

HUNTING PRESSURE 

All hunters entering and leaving the Athabaska Forest 
Reserve by vehicle must register at the checking station 
at Entrance but nonresident hunters, in company with guides, 
usually enter and leave through Jasper Park. Therefore, 
while a complete check is not possible the bulk of the 
game passing out of the Reserve is recorded. Sheep, goat, 
caribou and grizzly are the chief animals hunted by non- 
residents so the figures on deer, elk, and moose at the 
checking station can be regarded as very close to the 
actual total killed. 

Kill figures for 1952 from the Entrance Checking 


Station are as follows; 

Deer ---------- 42 

Caribou ------- 2 

Elk ---------- 3 

Sheep -- 9 

Goat -------- 12 

Moose ----------44 

Bear (Grizzly)-__£. 

Total- 108 


Four hundred and seventy hunters were checked into 
the Reserve in 1952 - making a game return of one animal 
per 4.4 hunters. Of the 108 animals taken 44 or 40.7$

were moose. This heavy kill of moose may be attributed 
to two basic factors. First, moose are among the easiest 
of the big game animals to kill at any time and two years 
protection through closed seasons has made them even less 
wary. Therefore they presented extremely easy targets 
for the sportsmen. Second, after the moose had been off 
the hunting lists for those years many nimrods undoubtedly 
wanted to try for the newly legalized trophies. It seems 
to be human nature for people to rush after something 
they’ve been deprived of for a while. From the practical 
hunter’s standpoint moose provide the largest quantity, 
as well as some of the choicest, meat of any of the game 
species - therefore who will take 100 pounds of deer 
meat when they can just as easily bring in 500-600 
pounds of equally good moose meat? 

The moose have certainly borne the brunt of the 
hunting pressure this past season and if this condition 
continues for another year or two serious complications 
may arise through the reduction of the male population. 

In my estimation the opening of a full season on moose 
this year after protecting them for some time was an 
ill-advised move that should not be repeated. It seems 
to me that the animals have been subjected to greater 
slaughter through having become less wary during years

of protection. A season of restricted hunting would have 
given the animals a chance to become accustomed once more 
to being stalked without having the population shot to 
pieces. Fortunately only limited areas of the Reserve 
are accessible by road and therefore the hunting is 
largely confined to these regions. As long as only a 
small portion of the population is subjected to the heavy 
hunting pressure the overall effect on the population 
as a whole will be negligible since animals from the 
inaccessible areas will drift in to repopulate the 
decimated regions.

CONCLUSIONS 

On the basis of the material presented in this 
thesis it is possible to draw several basic conclusions 
about the ecological status of the moose in the Rock 
Lake area of the former Athabaska Forest Reserve. 

The Rock Lake area, with its wide range of veget- 
-ational types, provides excellent moose habitat at the 
present time. However, re,growth of burned tracts will 
eliminate large areas of browse within the next twenty 
years and thus bring about a notable reduction in the 
carrying capacity of the range. The solution to this 
problem appears to be controlled burning of selected areas 
to set up new cycles of plant succession which are favorable 
to moose. The effect of logging on the habitat structure 
of the area may be considered negligible at present but 
beneficial over a prolonged period through new successions 
set up. 

Data obtained from 55 skulls indicate that the moose 
in the area may be classified as intergrades between the 
Montana moose, A. a. shirasi , and the western Canadian 
subspecies A. a. andersoni . 

Seasonal distribution of the animals indicates that 
a general movement to the higher ridges occurs in the 
spring and that a similar shift back to the valleys occurs 
in the fall. However, there is no indication of any

lengthy seasonal migrations. 

Results of the food studies show that aspen poplar 
and willow leaves together with some aquatics and grasses 
constitute the major portion of the moose’s summer diet. 
Willow, bog birch, pine, aspen and buffaloberry are the 
most important winter browse species. 

Salt lick studies indicated that the sodium ion was 
the important element which drew the animals to the natural 
salt licks. The wide occurance of licks throughout the 
area seems to indicate that game in general is fairly 
evenly distributed. 

Browse studies and population estimates have shown 
that the area is capable of supporting a greater moose 
population than exists at present. Although the population 
is evidently holding its own the birth rate and survival 
of young is not sufficient to produce an appreciable 
increase in the near future. Predation, competition and 
disease do not appear to be critical factors in holding 
the population at its present level. In view of this, one 
possible factor which could conceivably be holding the 
population In check is an unsatisfactory sex ratio. 

Under present conditions, with cows outnumbering the bulls 
three to one, the chances of all females being serviced 

as they come Into heat are greatly reduced. With an 
excess of cows present the selective breeding effect.

which acts through the competition of bulls for mates, 
is at a minimum. Thus every sexually mature male, 
regardless of his suitability as breeding stock, has 
ample opportunity to breed one or more cows. If the sex 
ratio were evenly balanced competition between bulls 
would be greatly increased and only the finest, most 
virile specimens would have the opportunity to breed. 

This in turn would mean that the calves produced would 
possess a better genetic heritage and a correspondingly 
greater chance of survival. Breeding for quality has 
proven highly successful with domestic stock and there 
seems little reason why the knowledge developed there 
should not be applicable in game management. In this 
matter, too, there arises the problem of the selective 
effect of hunting on the bull population. While it is 
true that the breeding is over before hunting commences 
there still remains the fact that the prime breeding stock 
of the next two or three years is being picked out for 
slaughter. No stock breeder in his right mind would ever 
consider killing off his prize bulls but this very policy 
is being followed year after year with big game species. 

Is it any wonder then that the hunters report smaller 
heads and more disease infestation] 

On the basis of the information I have at my disposal 
at the present time I would recommend that, if the season

is to be opened on moose in 1953 in the Athabaska Forest 
Reserve, it be made legal to shoot cows in an effort to 
establish a more favorable sex ratio. Such a policy is 
bound to bring with it a number of problems that can only 
be solved through rigid control of hunting activities. 

When cows are hunted there is always the possibility that 
a number of calves will be orphaned and left to the mercy 
of predators. This situation can be minimized only if 
the persons doing the hunting are experienced and cons¬ 
cientious outdoorsmen. How this might be achieved without 
restricting the rights of every individual to hunt I am 
not prepared to say. There is also the problem of 
regulating the kill in order that excessive slaughter of 
either sex will not occur. One possible method of handling 
the hunting activity would be to carry out a short game 
census just prior to the opening of the season and then, 
on the basis of the data obtained, set the number of 
animals of each sex which could be taken without affecting 
the breeding stock. Once the prescribed number of animals 
had been shot the season would automatically be closed. 
Another alternative would be to carry out a draw for a set 
number of hunting permits. Undoubtedly there would be a 
great deal of public indignation over any set of regulations 
which might accompany such a change in hunting practise 
but no experiment, biological or otherwise, can validly

be carried out unless all possible factors are rigidly 
controlled* 

The status of the moose in Alberta is far from 
satisfactory and, while it is unlikely that correction 
of a single factor can remedy the situation, no possibility 
should be overlooked. Therefore, I offer the suggestion 
that hunting of females be carried out on an experimental 
basis to ascertain the possible effects on population 
trends*

Director, Dr. R. B. Miller. In order that the problem 
of declining moose populations might be given fullest 
possible study the area formerly known as the Athabaska 
Forest Reserve was chosen for active field work since it 
possessed some of the best moose concentrations in the 
province. Though work was carried on in an area remote 
from the Biological Station itself the project was 
considered part of the Station programme. 

I am also indebted to the National Research Council 
of Canada for making funds available, through a post¬ 
graduate bursary, to assist me in completing the final 
year of my studies. 

A special vote of thanks is due Mr. Ward and Mr. 
Milne of the Soils Department, University of Alberta, 
for their efforts in analysing the soil samples from 
the salt licks; also Mr. J. E. Kelso, Provincial Analyst, 
who carried out determinations on the water samples. 

I am grateful to Dr. Wilton and the staff of the 
Provincial Veterinary Laboratory for the instruction 
they gave me in performing postmortem examinations and 
also for the pathological studies they made on moose 
material I sent them during the summer. 

Last but certainly not least, I wish to extend my 
sincerest thanks to Mr. Stan Clark of Entrance. His 

ungrudging assistance and companionship contributed 
largely to the success of my studies and did much to 
make my time in the field most memorable.
