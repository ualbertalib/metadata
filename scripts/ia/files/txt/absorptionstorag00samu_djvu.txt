PREFACE 


"Vitamins are organic compounds which are required 
for normal growth and maintenance of life of animals, 
including man, who, as a rule, are unable to synthesize 
these compounds by anabolic processes that are independent 
of environment other than air, and which compounds are 
effective in small amounts, do not furnish energy and 
are not utilized as building units for the structure of 
the organism, but are essential for the transformation 
of energy for the regulation of the metabolism of 
structural units” (1). 

This definition which is generally accepted implies 
that vitamins cannot be synthesized in the organism of 
man or animals. With the exception of vitamin D they 
are always supplied to the organism as normal food con¬ 
stituents and are readily absorbed from the intestinal 
tract into the blood stream which transports them to the 
tissues where they are utilized. Insofar as is known 
the animal organism has no special storage depots for 
vitamins and so long as adequate dietary sources are 
available an optimum level of vitamins is maintained 
in the blood and tissues. While some special organs 
contain increased amounts, no adequate explanation has 
been advanced to account for this increase. That these 
organs are not storage depots in the same sense as the 
liver is for glycogen is illustrated In the fact that

while the glycogen reserve may be entirely depleted in 
starvation, the vitamin A content of the liver though 
somewhat reduced, may yet be considerable even in the 
presence of symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. 

While the mechanism of storage for distribution is 
apparently lacking, the organism does maintain a certain 
normal concentration. Thus, it is well known that the 
healthy organism, having an adequate vitamin supply, 
excretes the amounts in excess of the "normal" concen¬ 
tration. They are not excreted or excreted only to a 
limited extent at times of low vitamin intake, even 
when abundant quantities are present in the organism. 

Administration of excessive amounts increases the 
quantity excreted, the water soluble vitamins being 
lost in the urine, the fat soluble vitamins in the feces. 
The quantities used in metabolic processes are apparently 
completely burned and so far no degradation products 
have been identified in the excreta. Small amounts are 
secreted Into the nutritional materials necessary for 
the proper growth and development of the offspring. 

Thus milk and eggs contain small but definite amounts.

INTRODUCTION 


Structure 

Vitamin A (axerophthol, vitamin A t , epithelium pro¬ 
tecting, or antixerophthalmic vitamin) has the following 
structure (2): 



Occurrence kL 

Vitamin A occurs only in the animal organism - it 
has not been found in plants. The most important source 
is in liver oils, in which it is present in the unsaponi- 
fiable fraction of the fat. Vitamin A occurs in organs 
other than the liver, the most important of these are the 
pyloric ceca of a number of fish species. These contain 
an amount equal to that found in the liver (3). The 
rest of the intestinal tract contains smaller amounts. 
Considerable quantities are present in the retina and 
the corpora lutea and small amounts in lungs and kidney 
(4). Vitamin A is also present in egg yolk (5) and 
milk (6) (7).

Vitamin A occurs both as the free alcohol and in 
esterified form in the animal organism (8) (9). The 
palmitate has been isolated from the liver oil of 
Stereolepis ishnagi (10) (11), and from cod liver oil 
(12) in the form of an addition product with moleic 
anhydride. 

Pronerties 

Vitamin A crystallizes from methanol in pale yellow 
plates, containing solvent of crystallization and melt¬ 
ing at 8°C• (15). Purer crystals, melting at 63-64°C. 
were obtained from ethyl formate and from ethylene 
glycol (14)• 

The absorption spectrum of vitamin A in the ultra¬ 
violet shows a sharp band at 328 mp with an extinction 
coefficient llfm » 1725 (13). Vitamin A has a biological 
activity of 4,500,000 I.U. per gram (15), the I.U. 
being defined as: 

1 I.U. (International Unit) « 0.6r of pure 
g-oarotene, m.p. 184°C. 

IT (gamma) - 0.001 mg. = 10“ 6 g. 

Vitamin A is readily oxidized, heat stable in an 
inert atmosphere, and is readily stabilized in solution 
in oil. It is destroyed by ultraviolet light and is 
optically inactive. Vitamin A is soluble in most organic 
solvents, but is insoluble in water. Thus it is classed 
among the fat soluble vitamins (16).

Formation of vitamin A from provitamin A 

The relationship between the green color of plants 
and vitamin A was first suggested by Steenbock in 1919 
(17) (18) (19) (20), who demonstrated the curative effect 
of fresh green plant material in rats with avitaminosis A, 
and that the healing action corresponded to the amount of 
carotene present. This was confirmed ten years later (21) 
(22), It was furthermore discovered that the vitamin A 
content of the liver of rats decreased rapidly and finally 
disappeared (23) completely when the animals were kept 
on an A-free diet. When carotene was added to the diet 
the vitamin A content of the liver increased again ranidly. 
About the same time Karrer (2) isolated vitamin A from 
the liver and establised its formula. 

Vitamin A contains just half as many carbon atoms 
as carotene. Theoretically, two mols of vitamin A must 
split out two mols of water to become g-carotene.

That the fission is not symmetrical is indicated 
by the observations of (24) (25). Even under optimum 
conditions p-carotene yields a maximum of only one mol 
of vitamin A together with other decomposition products. 

There is evidence that the conversion of pro¬ 
vitamins A to vitamin A takes place in the liver (26) 

(27) (28). The pancreas may also be involved since 
humans with juvenile diabetes mellitus are unable to 
convert carotene into vitamin A (29). 

The efficiency with which provitamins A are con¬ 
verted to vitamin A varies in different animals. Rats 
are most efficient (30) while cats are not capable of 
this conversion. Different species are able to utilize 
different provitamins to' different degrees. Thus, man, 
can convert carotenes to vitamin A, but finds it difficult 
to utilize cryptoxanthine (31). 

The in vitro conversion of provitamins A to vitamin 
A by the use of liver slices has been demonstrated (32) 
(33), the criterion used being an increased growth rate 
of fibroblasts in cultures. 

Closely allied compounds 

A. Yitamin A s - Whereas salt water fish contain 
vitamin A, fresh water fish contain a slightly different 
substance provisionally called vitamin A g (34) (35) (36). 
The constitution of vitamin A g is uncertain. It is 
differentiated from vitamin A by: 

(1) Ultraviolet absorption spectrum in alcohol

(Table 1). Vitamin A exhibits a maximum between 325 mp 
and 328 mp, vitamin A g between 345-350 mp with a sub¬ 
sidiary maximum at 285 mp (37), 

(2) Vitamin A exhibits bands at 610-620 mp with 
SbCl 3 , while vitamin A 2 shows maximum absorption at 
693-697 mp (38) (39) (40) (41), 

B. Vitamin A 3 - Short irradiation of solutions 
of vitamin A either increase or decrease the absorption 
maximum at 328 mp, but if the solution is allowed to 
stand in the dark absorption returns almost to the 
original value. It is suggested that variations in 
the proportions of cis-trans-isomers might explain 
these phenomena (42) (43), Higher absorption maxima 
are obtained when liver oils are saponified in the 
cold than when heat is applied (44). By absorption 
of vitamin A conventrate on calcium hydroxide a sub¬ 
stance is obtained with an absorption maximum at about 
270 mp (45) (46) (47). 

A separation of vitamin A from other active sub¬ 
stances has been achieved by extraction with 83 % alcohol 
(48), The soluble material resembles vitamin A in 
physical properties whereas the insoluble portion shows 
a greater biological value than would be anticipated 
from the reaction with antimony trichloride, or from 
spectrographic examination. A substance possessing 
similar characteristics was also obtained from whale 
liver oil by chromatographic adsorption on calcium

hydroxide (49). 

After the administration of a-carotene to rats a 
compound was observed which exhibited upon reaction with 
antimony trichloride an absorption maximum at about 
540 mp (50). It has been suggested that this substance 


may be vitamin A 3 .

Metabolism 

Provitamins A and vitamins A are readily absorbed 
from the intestinal tract. Absorption of vitamin A is 
related to the presence of fat. The more unsaturated the 
oil is the better the absorption. The absorption of pro¬ 
vitamins A and of vitamin A is furthermore linked to the 
presence of bile acids and apparently also of pancreatic 
lipase. In jaundice and choledochocolonostomized dogs 
carotene is not absorbed (52). Birds need some external 
supply of fat to utilize carotenes while practically no 
fat is necessary in the diet to utilize vitamin A 
properly (53). Both the provitamins A and vitamin A 
are transported through the organism by the blood and 
are present in the blood serum, the erythrocytes being 
completely devoid of these compounds. Removal from the 
serum is effected by the retieulo endothelial system

(54) (55), and large amounts of vitamin A are stored in 
the liver (56), Small amounts are also stored in the 
adrenal cortex, in the corpus iuteum of the ovary, and 
to a slight extent in the renal cortex and tissue fat. 
Traces may be found in the lungs and the intermediary 
part of the pituitary (57)«

EXPERIMENTAL 


The Problem 

A large part of vitamin A administered cannot be 
accounted for. This statement is based on the findings 
of several investigators who place the value variously 
between 96% and 80%. When a single dose of vitamin A 
of 10,000 I.U. is administered orally to humans the 
blood vitamin A level rises to a .maximum in 4-5 hours 
and declines gradually to the original level within 8 
hours. It is usually assumed that the decline In the 
curve is associated with the following metabolic pro¬ 
cesses: 

(1) storage of vitamin A in the liver and other 
organs. 

(2) destruction of vitamin A in the tissues. 

(3) utilization in living processes. 

(4) conversion into certain chemically undefined 
substances. 

Information with regard to these processes either 
lacks confirmation, is inconclusive or is not available. 
It seemed Important then to investigate some of these 
processes. 

The rat was chosen as the experimental animal 
since it is commonly used by most investigators and 
since this animal is especially efficient in handling 
vit am in A and carotene. This thesis is concerned solely

with the problem of utilization and storage of vitamin A, 
the source being an active concentrate of shark liver oil 
standardized spectrographically to contain 112,000 I.XJ. 
of vitamin A per gram. 

Outline of Investigation 

Experiments were designed to study; 

A. Destruction of administered vitamin A in the 
gastro intestinal tract. 

B. Rate of absorption of vitamin A from the gastro 
intestinal tract. 

C. Distribution of vitamin A in blood and liver 
at intervals following the administration of; 

1. A single dose of vitamin A. 

2. Repeated doses of vitamin A over varying 
periods followed by a single dose. 

3. Daily doses over a time period of such 
duration that no further increase in liver 
storage could be demonstrated with continued 
administration of vitamin A. 

D. Rate of depletion of vitamin A in the liver 
"saturated” with vitamin A, the animals being 
maintained on a vitamin A-free diet. 

Apparatus 

(1) A Bellingham and Stanley Quartz Spectrograph 
fitted with a rotating sector mounted directly on the 
instrument was used. The light source is a spark between 
tungsten steel electrodes. Two one cm. cells, fitted

with quartz ends, permit comparison of solution and sol¬ 
vent, in respect to transmission of light. An adjustable 
sector opening behind the solvent cell compensates for the 
increased exposure times and permits matching of adjacent 
strip photographs for density. The photograph covers wave 
lengths from 4651A to 2210ii units. 

(2) A Coleman Bell Double Monochromator Spectro¬ 
photometer. A Monochromator forms a spectrum of high 
purity from which a desired wave length can be selected. 

A cuvette carrier makes possible the introduction of the 
unknown and reference samples into this beam and a gal¬ 
vanometer determines the fraction of light which each 
sample transmits. 

Method of Extraction 

The principle of the method is outlined in the 
flow sheet. 

Reagents 

1. 95 percent Ethanol. 

2. Low B.P. petroleum ether. C.P. petrol ether 
B.P. below 60°C. was redistilled using a 
fractionating column, and the fraction boiling 
under 40 °C, used. 

3. 60$ KOH in Ethanol. 

4. Chloroform - Chloroform C.P. was used without 
further drying or purification. Exposure to 
air has been kept at a minimum by opening 
quantities which last only a short time.

Procedure 

The method of estimation followed the Carr Price pro¬ 
cedure (58) outlined (59) and modified (60) for this purpose. 

The weighed tissue was minced and extracted with small 
amounts of alcohol followed by small amounts of petrol ether. 
The petrol ether (from these combined alcohol petrol ether 
extracts) was removed by evaporation under nitrogen. The 
alcohol soluble extract was measured and 10 c.e. aliquots 
saponified with 20$ v/v (alcoholic KOH) by refluxing for 
5 minutes. After cooling the mixture an equal volume of 
distilled water was added and the unsaponifiable fraction 
extracted with three 15 c.e. portions of petrol ether. 

The combined petrol ether extracts were washed several 
times with distilled water, the washes discarded, and the 
extract dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The petrol 
ether was removed under nitrogen at 30°-40°C. The residue, 
dissolved in 10 c.c. of chloroform, one c.e. of which was 
treated with 9 c.c. of 25$ antimony trichloride reagent 
and the blue color was measured spectrophotometrically 
at 620 mp. 

The results were calculated using the equation 
L value * 0.0525 x L 6g0 mp (61) (62). Multiplying this 
result by 58,500 gives the approximate equivalent of 
vitamin A in international units (62).

SECTION A 

Destruction of administered vitamin A in the gastro 

intestinal tract 

Between 80$ and 96$ of vitamin A administered orally 
cannot be accounted for (63) (64). It has been shown that 
in rats (65), and in humans (65) (66) (67) (68), given an 
oral dose of vitamin A, the conventration in the blood 
reaches a maximum in three to five hours and declines 
gradually to the original level within 8 hours. This is 
in agreement with the general conception of fat absorption 
and suggests that vitamin A remains in contact with gastric 
and intestinal juices for several hours and might undergo 
some changes. 

This section deals with the investigation of the 
effect of natural and artificial gastric and intestinal 
juices on vitamin A in vitro and in vivo. With this in 
view the following preparations were examined spectro- 
graphically. 

(a) An 0.01$ solution vitamin A concentrate as 
shark liver oil in cyclohexane ethanol mixture (£0:80). 

The result (Fig. 1) shows an absorption maximum at 

338 mp. This is characteristic of vitamin A (Table 1) 

(51). 

(b) Stomach contents of 1 rat incubated for 1 l/S 
hours at 37°-40°C. with 0.016$ vitamin A concentrate at 
a pH of 2.

was extracted as outlined in the flow sheet and the vitamin 
A content examined spectrographically in cyclohexane ethanol 
mixture (20:80). The same procedure was used in (c), (d) 
and (e). 

(c) Small intestinal contents of 1 rat incubated for 
1 l/2 hours at 37°-40®C. with 0.032% vitamin A concentrate 
at a pH of 8.2. 

Results - (b and c) - Fig. 2. 

Where stomach contents were used there are two maxima, 
one at 270 mp and another at 280 mp. No specific absorp¬ 
tion was observed where the intestinal contents were used.

Result - This shows a decrease in absorption at 
328 mp as compared with vitamin A concentrate (Fig. 1), 
but no absorption bands in the other regions of the 
spectrum. 

(e) An 0.01% solution of vitamin A concentrate in¬ 
cubated for 30 minutes at 37°-4Q°C. with 1.27% pancreatin 
in 0.3% sodium carbonate solution at a pH of 8.6. 

Result - Fig. 3. There are two absorption maxima, 
one at 275 mp with a corresponding decrease at 328 mp.

Procedure - Three rats starved overnight were each 
fed 5,000 I.U. of vitamin A as shark liver oil. Five and 
one-half hours later the animals were killed and the 
stomach contents and the small intestinal contents were 
extracted as outlined. The vitamin A content was examined 
spectrographically. 

Results - The results (Figs. 4 and 5) showed absorp¬ 
tion curves with a maximum at 275 mp and a decrease at 
528 mp and closely simulate those obtained by in vitro 
experiments on vitamin A concentrate and pancreative 
sodium carbonate mixture. 

Discussion 

The appearance of absorption at 275 mp reported to 
be present In extracts of blood has been interpreted as 
being due to a decomposition product of vitamin A (66). 

Our findings indicate that this substance can be 
produced in vitro by the incubation of vitamin A con¬ 
centrate with pancreative sodium carbonate mixture and 
that it is present in the intestine of rats following 
the oral administration of vitamin A. Its presence in 
the blood may then be accounted for by absorption from 
the intestine. 

The existence of other forms of vitamin A has been 
discussed. Isomers and homologs of vitamin A might 
possibly be active ingredients of fish liver oils. The 
similarity between the substance absorbing at 275 mp in 
our experiments and the compound obtained by adsorption

of vitamin A on calcium hydroxide (45) (46) (47), its 
spectrographic resemblance to vitamin A 2 (Table 1), make 
it hardly likely that this substance represents destruc¬ 
tion in the biologic sense, 

SECTION B 

Rate of absorption of a single dose of 5,000 LU, of 

vitamin A 

The rapid absorption of vitamin A by rats parallels 
the rapid absorption by children, as observed by Clausen 
(65), who reports that the vitamin A content of the blood 
reaches a maximum 4 to 5 hours after its administration. 
Similar results were observed in humans by Lepage and 
Pett (66), Chesney and McCoord (67), d f Hass and 
Meulemans (68)• 

Destruction of large amounts of vitamin A in the 
intestinal tract was suggested by Baumann and co-workers 
(63), who observed only 10 percent of the administered 
dose in the liver in 48 hours. Similar results were 
obtained by Davies and Moore (64), but the experiments 
of McCoord and Clausen (69) indicate that between 25 to 
70 percent of the injested vitamin A may be stored. An 
analysis of the reported values indicates that there is 
no clear agreement regarding the rate and extent of ab¬ 
sorption and storage. In many cases the data are in¬ 
adequate or lacking.

Procedure - Three rats were used for each determina¬ 
tion. These were fed on a complete stock diet (checker), 
starved overnight and then fed 5,000 X.U. of vitamin A 
as shark liver oil. The animals were killed at 17 inter¬ 
vals during 48 hours. Analyses were performed on the 
stomachs, stomach contents, small intestines, small in¬ 
testinal contents, caeeums and contents, blood and liver 
by the procedure outlined in the flow sheet. 

Results - The results, which are collected in Table 3 
and illustrated by Pigs. 6 , 7 and 8 indicate that in the 
well fed animal given a single dose of 5,000 I.IT. of 
vitamin A, 90$ disappears from the gastro intestinal 
tract within 34 hours. It becomes evident in the small 
intestine in 15 minutes and reaches a peak (50$ of dose) 
after 3 hours. At the end of this time it is found in 
the caecum and reaches a peak (8$ of test dose) in 6 
hours. That actual absorption takes place in the small 
intestine is indicated by the gradual increase of vitamin 
A in the intestinal wall (Pig. 7). The level of vitamin 
A in the stomach wall foHows closely the curve of vitamin 
A concentration in the blood and suggests resecretion from 
the blood. At the end of 34 hours, there is still a small 
amount of the administered dose in the stomach and small 
intestine. The caecum and large instestine contain about 
10 percent of the test dose and represents the amount 


excreted

Rate of absorption of 5.000 I.U. of vitamin A in animals 

receiving criming doses of vitamin A 

It has been suggested (63) that the previous dietary 
history has an effect on the rate of absorption and degree 
of storage of vitamin A. It is claimed that adequately 
fed animals store vitamin A more efficiently than animals 
with vitamin A deficiency* To test these statements 
experiments were designed to determine the effect of ad¬ 
ministering 5*000 I.IT* of vitamin A to: 

(a) Animals which had received 4 doses of 5,000 I.TJ. 
over a period of 10 days* 

(b) Animals which had received 15 doses of 8,500 I.U. 
over a period of 30 days. 

Procedure - Nine rats were used in each case. Three 
rats served as control and the remaining 6 rats were each 
fed 5,000 I.U. of vitamin A at intervals of 6 l/2 hours 
and 84 hours, the stomachs, small intestines, caecums and 
large intestines, with their respective contents, and 
livers were examined for vitamin A. 

Results - The results, collected in Table 3 indicate 
that when animals which had received priming doses of 
vitamin A for varying lengths of time are given a sub¬ 
sequent single dose of 5,000 I.U., the emptying time of 
the stomach is increased (Table 8 and 3, Fig. 6).

5000 I.U. in animals which received 42,500 I.IT. divided in fifteen doses over thirty 
days. 

















SECTION C 


Distribution of vitamin A in blood and liver following 

the administration of : 

1. A single dose of 5,000 I.U* of vitamin A. 

(Table 2, Figs* 6, 7 and 8) 

About 15 minutes after the test dose is administered 
the blood vitamin A increases and rises to a peak at 2 
hours* It then falls slowly reaching the fasting level 
in 24 hours* One hour after the test dose storage is 
evident in the liver* At 6 hours about one third of the 
dose is found in the liver and a peak [38% of test dose) 
is reached at 6 l/2 hours. This level is wellmaintained * 
for 48 hours. The difference in times between the peak 
level in the blood (2 hours) and that in the liver 
(6 l/2 hours) indicates that vitamin A is removed from 
the circulation rather slowly, even when the blood con¬ 
centration is rather high. 

2. Priming doses of vitamin A over varying periods 
followed by a single dose of 5,000 I.U. 

The results, Table 3, indicate that the rate of 
liver storage remains unaltered but the amount stored is 
58% of the administered dose at 6 l/2 hours. This find¬ 
ing of increased ability of the liver to store vitamin A 
under these conditions is in agreement with that of other 
investigators (64) (69) (70)*

3. Daily doses of 5,000 I.U. of vitamin A to the 

point where no further increase in liver storage 
could be effected by continued administration. 

It is apparent (Table 3) that the capacity of the 
liver for storing vitamin A is very great. It seemed 
important to determine what that capacity actually is and 
how long it would take to ’’saturate" the liver with a 
given dose of 5,000 I.U. daily, and how long it would 
take to deplete the saturated liver on a vitamin A-free 
diet. 

Procedure - For this purpose 44 animals, 9 weeks 
old and weighing about 160 grams, were given a vitamin A- 
free diet. These were fed 5,000 I.U. of vitamin A daily 
and one animal was killed every 24 hours. Thus the first 
animal v/ould have had 5,000 I.U., the second 10,000 I.U. , 
the third 15,000 I.U. and so on. The animal killed on 
the 16th day had received 80,000 I.U. of vitamin A in 
that period of time. 

Results - The results,. (Table 4, Fig. 9) are con¬ 
verted into vitamin A per gram of liver and indicate 
that saturation was effected in 16 days when the con¬ 
centration per gram of liver was about 2,300 I.U. of 
vitamin A. 

The concentration per gram of liver proceeded in 
a regular fashion and could be expressed in terms of a 
straight line function. At the end of 16 days, and for 
6 days thereafter, while vitamin A administration was

continued the values appear fairly constant, suggesting 
that no more vitamin A was being stored under these con¬ 
ditions. 


SECTION D 

Rate of depletion of vitamin A from "saturatedliver 

in animals on a vitamin A-free diet 
Procedure - Following ZZ days, during which 5,000 I.U. 
were administered daily, vitamin A dosage was discontinued 
and the rats were maintained on an A-free diet. On the 
34th day the animals were labelled and the weights were 
recorded periodically. At varying intervals of time, 
single animals were sacrificed and the vitamin A content 
per gram of liver was determined. 

Results - The results (Figs. 9 and 10) indicate that 
after a two week period in which no marked decrease in 
vitamin A was evident, there followed a period of rapid 
depletion coincident with weight loss. The liver ap¬ 
parently gives up its vitamin A stores more rapidly in 
this period than could be accounted for the known 
vitamin A requirement (4 I.U. per day). 

It is apparent (Fig. 9) that the rapid expenditure 
of vitamin A was follovved by a less rapid decline. This 
is in agreement with other observers (71). At the end 
of 5 months the liver still contains 461 I.U. per gram, 
but the animals show no signs of vitamin A deficiency.

This follows closely experiments performed on humans (72), 
in whom it was observed that subjects initially well sup¬ 
plied with vitamin A may undergo as much as six months 
of vitamin A deprivation without developing evidence of 
vitamin A deficiency. 

These experiments are being continued to determine 
the time necessary for complete depletion and the develop¬ 
ment of avitaminosis A.

SUMMARY 


1* It has been demonstrated that when gastric and in¬ 
testinal juices are incubated with oily solutions of 
vitamin A a substance having specific absorption at 
275 mp is formed. It is suggested that the reported 
presence of this material in blood has its origin in 
the gastro intestinal tract. 

2. The rates of absorption of vitamin A in well fed 
rats and in rats fed priming doses of vitamin A have 
been determined. 

3. The vitamin A content of the blood of rats which 
received a dose of 5 f 000 I.U. has been determined at 
various subsequent intervals during 24 hours and a curve 
constructed. This curve follows closely that generally 
accepted for fat tolerance tests. 

4. The rates of storage of vitamin A in the liver have 
been studied and the capacity of the liver for this 
function has been quantitatively determined. 

5. The rate of depletion of vitamin A from the "fully 
saturated liver” has been determined. Final values for 
this are not as yet available.
