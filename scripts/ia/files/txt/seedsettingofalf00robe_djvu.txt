ABSTRACT 


Seed setting from cross-pollination was seven times 
higher than from self-pollination. 

The total exclusion of pollinating insects reduced the 
yield by 93$ of that of open check. Pollinating insects must 
therefore be an important factor in alfalfa seed production in 
Alberta. 

Bumble bees and leaf-cutter bees were effective trippers 
under cages. Honey bees proved to be of little consequence 
when compared with the: native trippers. They may increase the 
amount of automatic tripping. Leaf-cutter bees and bumble bees 
were found to be efficient cross-pollinators. Thereat ere so few 
flowers tripped in the honey bee cage that no definite conclu¬ 
sions could be drawn regarding their value as cross-pollinators. 

The results suggest that bumble bees are somewhat re¬ 
sistant to DDT. 

A locally constructed machine designed to trip alfalfa 
flowers was t ested. The raceme studies showed that the machine 
was an effective tripper, since it tripped up to 63 $ of the open 
flowers. The majority of these flowers did not set pods and seed 
per pod results indicated that a high degree of self-pollination 
occurs when flowers are tripped with this machine. Seed yields 
from the machine treated strips differed only slightly from those 
of untreated material.

INTRODUCTION 


Variability in seed setting continues to b^ the 
greatest problem in alfalfa seed production* Among growers and 
research men there is still no unanimity of opinion on such 
questions as automatic versus insect tripping, and the importance 
of cross- over self-pollination. Furthermore, recent investiga¬ 
tions have raised questions regarding the importance of the 
various species of bees as trippers and pollinators* 

From time to time, farmers and scientists have attem¬ 
pted to increase seed yield on a commercial basis by construct¬ 
ing tripping machines. Such a machine was locally manufactured 
and made available for testing. 

Lygus bugs are now known to be responsible for a to¬ 
tal loS3 of yield in some Alberta areas. DDT gives satisfactory 
control, but the effect of this insecticide on beneficial bees 
has not been fully ascertained* 

In this study self- and cross-pollination were com¬ 
pared with the tripping and pollination of leaf-cutter bees, 
honey bees and bumble bees. 

The machine was tested to determine whether the 
mechanical tripping would be followed by seed setting, and if 
the seed would result from self-or cross-pollination. 

A preliminary investigation was undertaken to study 
the effect of DDT on the activity of alfalfa-pollinating bees.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Tripping 

Tysdal (28), Hadfield and Calder (10), and Piper and 
co-workers (20), believe that under field conditions tripping 
is necessary for seed setting in alfalfa® 

Brink and Cooper (!}.) showed that fertilization can 
occur in the untripped flower® Tysdal (28), who reviews the 
findings of other workers, admits that some fertilization may 
take place in this manner but that it is the exceptional case 
and is of little importance in commercial seed production® 


Cross- and Self-Pollination 

Piper (20), Tysdal (27), Bolton (2) and Knowles (13), 
found a reduction in the number of pods set and the number of 
seeds per pod following self-fertilization as compared with 
cross-fertilization. Thus Tysdal (2?) obtained 92 % more pods 
and $6% more seeds from cross-pollinated than from self-pollin¬ 
ated flowers. Similarly Knowles (13) obtained an average of 
3.70 seeds per cross-pollinated flower and .56 seeds per self- 
pollinated flower in random Grimm selections.

Lesins (II 4 .) compared cross- with self-pollination under 
natural conditions in central Sweden* Cross-pollination in¬ 
creased the average pod setting by 2 * 24 , seed setting by 5*20 
and seeds per pod by 2.32 times over self-pollination* Bolton 
(2) working with material selected for high seed setting crossed 
30 and selfed 30 flowers on each of 10? plants* He obtained an 
average of 5*54 seeds per crossed flower and 1*50 seeds per 
selfed flower* This indicates that selling results in fewer 
seeds per pod than crossing* 

If seed yield alone were considered, augmenting the 
natural seed set with a method that would bring about tripping 
and subsequent self-fertilization would seem of value* Investi¬ 
gations indicate, however, that self-fertilization lowers the 
seed and forage productivity of the inbred progeny* Tysdal, 
Kiesselbach and Westover ( 29 ) found the actual reduction of 
yield to be 32$ for forage and 38 $ for seed from one generation 
of selfing. Hadfield and Calder (10) found in New Zealand 
that self-fertilization caused a decrease in seed and forage 
yields of subsequent generations. 

Cooper, Brink and Albrecht (7) and Brink and Cooper 
(5, 6, 8), studied histologically fertilization in alfalfa* The 
preliminary account (5) indicates that more seed may be formed 
after cross- than after self-pollination because of partial self¬ 
incompatibility; that is, the male gametophytes are less effective

in accomplishing fertilization in plants from which they arise 
than they are in unrelated individuals. There is also a dif¬ 
ference in survival of ovules containing inbred and hybrid em¬ 
bryos and endosperms. Inbred embryos more frequently collapsed 
during early development than did those resulting from cross¬ 
pollination. Brink and Cooper (6, 8) further found that 66*3$ 
of the crossed ovules became fertile, compared with only 
of the selfed ovules# This ms attributed to more extensive growth 
of the tubes from foreign pollen which enabled a higher proportion 
to reach the ovules, enter the microphyle and accomplish fertil¬ 
ization. They (8) found a rather uniform decline in ovule fer¬ 
tility from apex to base of the ovary. The gradient followed an 
almost parallel course for both the self- and cross-pollinated 
series, although the proportion of ovules becoming fertile in 
each position was considerably higher in the cross-pollinated 
series. They conclude that the partial self-incompatibility 
associated with self-pollination and the high incidence of 
ovule abortion resulting from inbred embryos accounts for 
the difference in seed production following crossing and self- 
ing# 

Stevenson and Bolton (25) indicate that self-tripping, 
self-fertile alfalfa plants are undesirable as a source of breed¬ 


ing material for improving the seed yield

The Importance of Bees 

Knowles (13) and others (9, 31) report a decrease in 
seed yield when insects are excluded from alfalfa plants* Jones 
and Olsen (12) indicated that bumble bees in cages increased 
the seed set from 3*6$ to l8*8$* Knowles (13) reports a de¬ 
crease from *90 seeds per uncaged flower to *11 seeds per caged 
flower* He concluded that the decrease was due primarily to the 
exclusion of bees rather than a change in environmental factors 
caused by caging* He believed that certain members of the genus 
Megac-hile are the most important trippers of alfalfa since they 
visited and tripped an average of 17«3 flowers per minute* Bumble 
bees were efficient trippers but were present in insufficient 
numbers to be as important as leaf-cutter bees* Honey bees were 
of little importance in the tripping of alfalfa flowers in 
S a sk a t che wan • 

Tysdal (27) concluded that wild bees are the main 
factor in alfalfa seed production and that certain members of 
the genera Megachlle and Nomia were the most important in the 
United States* He describes a noticeable decrease in seed yield 
corresponding to a related reduction in numbers of wild bees in 
the seed producing areas of the United States* In his studies 
he found that leaf-cutter bees tripped 81$ of the flowers visited, 
bumble bees tripped 38-80$, while honey bees tripped only 1.1$ 
of the flowers visited*

Akerberg and Lesins (1) working in central Sweden, 
rate bumble bees at 78 $, leaf-cutter bees at 100$ and honey 
bees at 0*83$ efficient. 

There are reports that under certain conditions 
honey bees may be important trippers and pollinators of alfalfa 
flowers* Vansell and Todd (30) report that honey bees are the 
main trippers in Millard county, Utah. Their explanation of 
this phenomena is based on pollen availability and competition* 

In Millard county, however, there are few pollen sources 
competing with alfalfa* Corn and greasewood are actually the 
only important competitors* Corn pollen is available to the 
bees only on humid mornings, while greasewood pollen is gathered 
only in the late afternoon* Thus the alfalfa flov/er is the bees 
only pollen source during the warm period of the day when the 
bees are most active. Hare and Vansell (11), also working in 
Millard county, observed honey bees tripping alfalfa flowers* 
Observation taken at hives situated strategically in the area 
showed that alfalfa pollen comprised 32$ of the total colle¬ 
cted over a three week period in 1944* Pedersen and Todd (19) 
in a test with potted plants situated near the apiary report 
that 77$ of the nectar collectors working through the ’'throat* 1 
bring about tripping* They state further that the majority of the 
honey bees gather nectar through the side openings of the flower*

Dwyer and Allman (9) indicate that honey bees are of 
importance in alfalfa seed production in New South Wales* 

Linsley (l£), Linsley and MacSwain (l6), point out 
that in California, alfalfa seed production is dependent on 
the activity of pollinating bees* During the summer of 19 
most of the pollinating bees were native species# In 1946 
however, pollen gathering honey bees were mainly responsible 
for the cross-pollination that occurred# 

Stevenson (24-) indicates that in Canada the most im¬ 
portant insect pollinators are the wild bees# The largest 
populations of these beneficial insects are found in the newer 
agricultural areas, this, he feels, accounts for the higher 
seed yields obtained in these districts# He believes that the 
populations of these insects are entirely inadequate in older 
more settled districts* 


Mechanical Tripping 

Tysdal (28) mentions that a number of mechanical 
devices have been used to trip alfalfa flowers in an attempt to 
increase seed setting# He feels, that to be of value, the 
machine must cross-pollinate as it trips the flowers. 

Silversides and Olson (21) tried a number of mechan¬ 
ical devices that met with little success# While the amount

of tripping was increased, seed set was less than that of 
the untreated check* Jones and Olson (12) used a machine 
with two vertical rotating rollers* Tripping was caused by the 
pressure exerted on the flowers as they were passed between the 
rollers* Various materials used as covers for the rollers were 
compared for pollen carrying ability. Tripping was increased 
from 11 % in the check to 53*5$ for the most intensive treat¬ 
ment. Unfortunately no seed yields were obtained. In a per¬ 
sonal communication Dr* Olson informed the writer that in later 
trials this machine had proved unsatisfactory* 


Lygus 

Sorenson (23) in his studies in Utah found that 
correlated with an increased concentration of lygus bugs there 
is an increase of blasted buds, flower drop and shrivelled 
seeds* Stitt (26), using cages, obtained an average destruction 
of 23*35 seeds per individual lygus* He obtained a significant 
positive correlation between the percentage of brown seeds and 
lygus bug concentration* Similar results were obtained by 
Bolton and Peck (3)* Stitt (26) indicates that the preferred 
habitat of the lygus is the tender terminal part of the alfalfa

plant where it causes serious damage to the flowering parts 
and to the developing embryos# Pedersen and Todd ( 18 ) found 
that practical protection against lygus damage to alfalfa could 
be obtained by the application of 20 lbs# of 10$ DDT (dichloro- 
diphenyl trichloroethane) dust per acre during the pre-bloom 
period# 


DDT and Bees 

The observations of Linsley and MacSwain (17) with 
DDT and its effect on bees are of interest# DDT appeared to 
repel honey bees, since the number of visitations fell rapidly 
after the dusting# Coincident with this, there was an increase 
in the numbers of honey bees visiting the untreated part of the 
fields# Gradually the population built up in the treated area 
until in three or four days after treatment it was equal to, 
or higher than that of the untreated plots# The population of 
native bees did not decrease as did honey bees# Smith et al 
(22) demonstrated that I 4 .O lbs# of DDT dust per acre applied 

three times during hie bloom season has a small but detrimental 

honey 

effect on theAproduction and activity of honey bees# They felt 
that this effect was offset by the increased nectar flow re¬ 
sulting from lygus control.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 


Test of Honey Bees, Leaf-Cutter Bees and Bumble Bees* 

and Controlled Selfing and Crossing, 


This study was carried in a field on the farm of 
Mr* K* McKen z ie of Tiger Lily* This district has been one of 
the surer seed setting areas of Alberta* 

Four wire screen cages of 3 ft* by 3 ft* by 3 ft. 
dimensions were placed on the field during the latter part of 
June prior to flowering. The following studies were conducted: 

A* Uncaged check* 

B* Excluding all pollinating bees. 

C* Containing five honey bees. 

D. Containing five bumble bees. 

E* Containing five leaf-cutter bees* 

Actively working bees of the various species were 
captured and put into the respective cages* In treatments 
C, D and E, the insects were released after 2lj_ hours and freshly 
caught bees introduced. 

In each treatment 25 racemes of fresh untripped flo¬ 
wers were tagged and the total number of flowers counted prior

to introduction of the various species of bees# The flowers 
on 25 racemes were tripped and selfed by means of a toothpick, 
a fresh toothpick being used for each plant# Controlled cross¬ 
pollination was performed by collecting pollen from unrelated 
plants on toothpicks and tripping the fresh flowers of 25 
racemes on these toothpicks# 

Records were obtained of each flower in all treat¬ 
ments from flowering to wilting or pod setting# At maturity 
the racemes were harvested, the number of pods were recorded 
and a count made of the number of seeds in each pod# 

The entire growth under each cage was harvested at 
maturity and yields of seed were obtained# The caged and un¬ 
caged check material was harvested and handled in a similar 
manner# 

Test With the Coutts-Ev.jen Yield Builder 

The principle of this machine was developed on a pilot 
model by Mr# Evjen, a farmer of the Stony Plain district# The 
Coutts Machine Co* Ltd# of Edmonton manufactured a field scale 
model in 194,9-50# The principle is that of vertical, sponge 
rubber-covered rollers working in pairs* As the machine moves 
along the top growth is passed between a pair of rotating 
rollers# The pressure and shearing force of the rollers accom¬ 
plishes the tripping# The machine is illustrated in Pigs# 1, 2, 
and 3.

The machine was tested at two different locations* 

One series of tests was conducted in the Tiger Lily area 
under seed setting conditions described earlier* It was felt 
that the machine should also be tested in an area where alfalfa 
does not usually set seed, as in the immediate Edmonton dis¬ 
trict* Such a field was made available for testing purposes by 
Mr* Sharpe of Edmonton* Owing to transportation difficulties, 
the strip tests were not exactly comparable in both locations* 
The following strip tests were conducted with the 
machine at the Sharpe farm: 


1* Once over* 

(la) Half of one treated once again at a later date* 

2* Twice over* 

(2a) Half of two treated once again at a later date. 

3* Three times over. 

(3a) Half of three treated once again at a later date. 
I}.* (a) Once over. 

(b) Over a second time at a later date. 

(c) Over a third time at a later date. 

5* Checks. 

Two untreated check £brips were left, one between treatments 
1 and 2, and one between treatments 3 and 4-*

Strips in Mr. McKenzie*s field were treated as follows 

1. Check strip. 

2. Once over. 

3# Twice over. 

i|.. Three times over. 

5>. Twice over at different dates. 

Tripping and subsequent seed setting in machine treated 
material was studied in the following manner: At Tiger Lily, 
prior to treatment with the machine, 2$ racemes, from which all 
pods, tripped flowers and buds were removed, were tagged. Im¬ 
mediately after treatment the flowers tripped by the machine 
were counted and all untripped flowers were removed. At 
Edmonton, racemes were tagged and records taken only in the 
strips that had been treated once. In September all tagged 
racemes were harvested, the number of pods per raceme and the 
number of seeds per pod recorded. 

Seed yields from the treated and untreated strips were 
computed on the basis of the seed weight from 10 one square 
yard samples harvested from each strip.

Test of Forage Yield 

A test was carried out in the greenhouse comparing 
the green weight of fresh material from seed obtained from 
the open check, from known selfing, from known crossing, and 
from flowers tripped by the machine# The experimental design 
was a Ij. x If Latin Square* 


Preliminary Studies of the Effect of DDT on Bees 

Cages similar to those described were used* Into 
one cage six bumble bees were introduced immediately after 
application of 10$ DDT dust to the enclosed plant material* 
Into a se cond cage, six bumble bees were introduced two days 
after the DDT treatment* Observations were made periodically 
to determine the effect the DDT had on the bees*

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


The Effect of Different Treatments on 
Alfalfa Seed Setting 


in Table 1 the data on tripping* pod setting and 
seed setting are summarized* 


Cross- and Self-Pollination 

The results from Table 1 indicate the importance of 
tripping followed by cross-pollination as contrasted with self- 
pollination. Selfing resulted in pod setting of only 31*6$ of 
the total flowers* Moreover* the pods that were formed contained 
an average of only 1*7 seeds per pod. Table 2 indicates how¬ 
ever, that there were two pods that contained five seeds. These 
may have been from plants that were more self-compatible than 
average Grimm plants. If tripping were followed by selfing* a 
relatively small proportion of the flowers would form pods, 
these pods would in turn contain relatively few seeds* as illus¬ 
trated in Pig. Ip.

The results of tripping followed by crossing are 
strikingly different from those of selfing. Pods formed from 
7i|*8^ of the treated flowers. In this treatment the major pro¬ 
portion of the pods contained more than three seeds per pod as 
indicated in Table 2# As can be seen from Pig* 5>, the 
appearance of racemes and pods corresponds with the actual counts 
of the number of pod sets and also of seeds per pod* These re¬ 
sults suggest that very likely most of the pods which had three 
or more seeds were the result of cross-pollination while those 
with two or less were the result of self-pollination* This in¬ 
terpretation appears valid since as can be seen from Table 2, 
the majority of the pods resulting from self-pollination had 
from one to two seeds per pod while those resulting from cross¬ 
pollination had three or more seeds per pod* These results 
are in agreement with those obtained by other workers (5, 13, 

20)* It is likely that the number of seeds per pod is a rel¬ 
iable criterion for determining the type of pollination that has 
taken place. 


The Exclusion of Pollinating Insects 

When all insects were excluded, only three out of 383 

flowers under study were tripped* These three formed pods con- 

expressed in 

taining only one or two seeds. The results fA Table 3 show

The Influence of Honey Bees 

Honey bees are of little value as trippers as indicated 
strikingly in Pig* 6. Prom Table 1 it can be seen that only 12 
of the If-73 flowers under study were tripped during the five days 
that they were exposed to honey bees. Throughout this study 
honey bees were observed many times in alfalfa fields but in 
no case were they seen to trip flowers at the time they visited

them* Furthermore pollen gathering honey bees were not seen 
in alfalfa fields during the course of this study* Seven of the 
12 flowers tripped set pods producing 26 seeds. Twenty three 
of these seeds were in three pods on raceme No. 10 shown in 
Figs. 6 and It does not appear reasonable to assume that 

these flowers on raceme No. 10, which resulted in what were ob¬ 
viously pods from cross-po3-lination (see Table 2), were actually 
tripped by honey bees# It is more likely that a honey bee vi¬ 
sited an automatically tripped flower and became covered with 
pollen unrelated to that of the flowers on raceme 10, Later 
the bee visited raceme 10, upon which four flowers had tripped 
automatically and brought about cross-pollination, which iould 
account for the high number of seeds developed in these pods. 

As in the caged check, pod setting occurred from 
some tagged flowers after removal of the bees and after close 
observation had been discontinued. The interesting and 
probably highly important point is that more automatic trip¬ 
ping occurred in the caged honey bee treatment after the re¬ 
moval of the bees than occurred throughout the entire test in 
the caged check. As Is indicated in Table 3> eight pods 
resulted from flowers which were tripped after the removal 
of the honey bees. These findings agree with those of 
Lesins (lip), who reports that nectar collecting honey bees 
increases the amount of automatic tripping. Though there was

very little difference in the total amount of seed produced 
under the two treatments it may well be that if honey bees 
had been kept in the cage for a longer period of time the 
yield would have been higher® The increase would not have 
been great, however, because the automatically tripped flowers 
would be self-pollinated* A possible explanation of the in¬ 
crease in automatic tripping due to the presence of honey bees 
may be that the removal of the nectar causes a loss in turgidity 
which might bring about more automatic tripping# 


The Influence of Leaf-Cutter Bees 

Caged leaf-cutter bees tripped 6±.0% of the flowers 

under observation# This figure is lower than that for bumble 

bees (Fig# 8)# The difference is probably a cage as well as a 

temperature effect# During the course of this study it was 

noted that these bees were seldom observed working at tempera- 
o 

tures below 70 F# In addition, the leaf-cutter bee prefers 
to trip only a few flowers on each raceme it visits# In the 
course of pollen gathering they fly far and fast# The effect 
of caging undoubtedly upset their normal behavior® Conse¬ 
quently they spent most of their time trying to escape, and

worked relatively fewer hours than did the bumble bees. The 
percentage of tripped flowers forming pods is 61$. This high 
value and the distribution frequency in Table 2 indicates that 
these bees are efficient cross-pollinators* This is further 
substantiated by the data of seeds per pod* Pods from leaf- 
cutter bee tripped flowers contained an average of 4*5 seeds 
which is almost identical to the number of seeds resulting 
from known cross-pollination. (See Pigs. 4 and 7). 


The Influence of Bumble Bees 

It can be seen from Table 1, Pig* 8, that bumble bees 
are very efficient trippers of alfalfa flowers under caged con¬ 
ditions. These bees tripped ^0.2% of the tagged flowers. Of 
the tripped flowers, 62$ set pods. It is possible that this 
latter percentage would be higher under natural conditions, 
since near the end of the observation period few fresh flowers 
remained and some of the flowers tripped were not in the best 
physiological condition for seed setting. The data on the 
number of seeds per pod (Table 2, Pig. Ij.) indicates that the 
majority of pods formed from bumble bee tripped flowers were 
the result of cross-pollination. Pigs. 5> and 7 illustrate 
strikingly the difference between racemes from the bumble bee

cages and those from known self-pollinated flowers as well as 
their similarity to the racemes upon which the flowers were 
known to be cross-pollinated. 

Fig. 8 shows that under cages bumble bees are the 
superior trippers. This may be a temperature effect. Through¬ 
out this investigation it was noticed that bumble bees could 

be found tripping alfalfa flowers when the temperature was no 
, o 

higher than 50 F. The increased tripping of the caged bumble 
bees may in part be due to their ability to work at lower tem¬ 
peratures. Not all bumble bees are pollen gathers« The pollen 
gatherers can be readily distinguished in the field by the 
large loads of pollen they carry on their legs. Those that 
seek only nectar enter the alfalfa flower through the side 
openings, as do the nectar collecting honey bees, and while 
visiting them seldom trip the flowers. 


Seed Setting Under Natural Conditions 

Of the total flowers studied in the uncaged check, 
ij.6.1# were tripped. This is a high percentage for natural 
conditions and is undoubtedly due to the large number of trip¬ 
ping insects present in this field at the time of flowering.

The percentage of tripped flowers setting pods is 
lower for the uncaged check than for the bumble bee and leaf- 
cutter bee treatments. If bees are responsible for most of 
the tripping occurring under natural conditions we should expect 
to find a fairly close relationship between the three mentioned 
treatments. It may be that the lower pod setting percentage 
in the uncaged check material was caused by the effects of 
temperature and plant condition. The season of 19!?0 was ex¬ 
tremely dry and the shade afforded by the cages may have re¬ 
duced the moisture loss. The growth under the cages was more 
vigorous and the flowers were larger and appeared fresher. 

They may have been physiologically more suited to pod pro¬ 
duction. 

The seeds per pod data in Table 1, Table 2, and Fig. 

4# indicate conclusively that the majority of the tripping 
occurring under natural conditions was accompanied by cross¬ 
pollination. Since little automatic tripping occurs, and 
since it has been shown that wind pollination can be disre¬ 
garded (31)# the pollen collecting bee must be the agent which 
trips the flowers and carries the pollen from flower to flower. 

The yield of this field was approximately 2^5 pounds 
per acre* The calculated yield of the caged bumble bee treat¬ 
ment was 213 pounds per acre. It should be pointed out, how¬ 
ever, that this seed was produced from only those flov/ers which

were open during the five days that the bees were in the 
cages. A much higher yield would have resulted had the bees 
been kept in the cages during the entire period of flowering. 
Had this population been equalled under natural conditions 
during the entire flowering period, the yield would have been 
much higher. 


General Observations 

The major proportion of the seed set in this field 
was due to the tripping and cross-pollination brought about by 
bumble bees. Leaf-cutter bees were present but in insufficient 
numbers to be of importance. Bumble bees are a social species 
and it would seem that any program directed at increasing bee 
numbers should include a study of means of aiding the bumble 
bees in producing strong healthy colonies. Leaf-cutter bees 
are solitary and nest in beetle holes in timber and in hard 
ground. Numerous leaf-cutter bee nests were found in the road¬ 
way through the alfalfa field. A roadway would not appear to 
be a safe or intelligent place to put a nest but unless more 
suitable requirements are provided the bees will be forced to 
accept such undesirable nesting sites.

Weather conditions are important because they directly 
influence bee activity. If the weather is cold during the 
alfalfa flowering period, the bees are unable to work. The 
result will be that little seed is set under such conditions. 

Bees are exacting in their pollen requirements. 

Sweet clover and fireweed pollen is more attractive to bees 
than alfalfa pollen (31)# Consequently when these plants are 
growing near an alfalfa field the bees will likely visit them 
in preference to alfalfa. The control of these competing pollen 
sources would appear to be an important part of alfalfa seed 
production. 

It is a common practice in land clearing to windrow 
and burn the felled trees. Undoubtedly this is a near sighted 
practice since leaf-cutter bees nest in holes in timber.

the amount of seed that was set. Actually all the machine 
treated strips yielded less seed than the check, although in 
no cases were the differences significant. 

The results from tests on the Sharpe farm (Table $), 
likewise, were inconclusive. Only in one case, that of the 
twice over followed by once over at a later date, was the yield 
actually higher than the check 0 In this case the yield was not 
significantly higher than from the check strip closest to it. 

The mechanical tripper cannot be discarded on the 
basis of these tests alone but there are strong indications that 
its value as a builder of alfalfa seed is questionable. The 
results, especially in the Sharpe field, indicate that variability 
due to factors other than the machine had a greater effect 
upon seed yield. A gradient occurred in this field which accounts 

for the yield increase between Check I and Check II. In add- 

111 

ition, there was considerable variation between the yield of 
replicate square yard samples.

of tripped flowers is very similar to that occurring under 
natural conditions, but the similarity ends there* Naturally 
occurring pods contain approximately twice as many seeds* There 
are probably two main reasons for the lower number of seeds 
per pod* Firstly it was observed that the older flowers of the 
raceme were those most frequently tripped by the machine* This 
could be due to the greater ease of tripping of older flowers 
or because of the lack of bud protection. It was observed that 
a raceme containing a large number of buds as well as open flo¬ 
wers frequently escaped tripping by the machine because of the 
cushioning and protective effect afforded the flowers by the 
buds* Studies by Knowles (13) have shown that fewer pods are 
set when older flowers are tripped* Equally important is the 
fact that the major portion of the machine tripped flowers were 
probably self-pollinated. The results from Table 2 indicate 
that the distribution for the number of seeds per pod for the 
machine treatment is more similar to that for selfing than for 
crossing# The similarity of racemes and pods resulting from 
known selfing and machine tripping is further exemplified in 
Figs. 4 and 

As shown in Table 6 the data from the Sharpe and 
McKenzie fields differ in some respects. In the tests on the 
Sharpe field, once over with the machine tripped 4-6.3$ of the 
flowers, 29$ of which set pods while at the McKenzie field only

28.2$ of the flowers were tripped but of them ij_7$ set pods. The 
explanation probably is that there was a high concentration of 
wild bees^at Tiger Lily, (a random count of bumble bees gave a 
figure of approximately lj.000 per acre during warm sunny condi¬ 
tions). Consequently, there were fewer flowers left to wilt and 
the machine had to trip more young flowers. Relatively few 
bees were present, however, in the Sharpe field and the flowers 
persisted for a longer time. These older flowers, though they 
trip more easily, are known to be less fertile (13)• 

A review of the information gained about the machine 
shows that the machine does trip effectively but that it does 
not cross-pcllinate appreciably. The ultimate result is that 
under conditions of the test it neither increased or reduced 
the yield. It is conceivable that if few or no pollinating bees 
were pres:ent the machine might be of some value. It is question¬ 
able if the seed from machine tripped flowers would be desirable 
because of the proportion of selfed seed. Some cross-pollination 
is brought about and improvements in this regard are needed if 


the machine is ever to be a success

Test of Seedling Yields from Seed Obtained by Different 
Methods of Pollination 

This test was conducted in the greenhouse with the 
objective of establishing if yields of forage would be notice¬ 
ably depressed in plants from seed obtained from the mechanically 
tripped flowers# The results are summarized in Table 7»

is surprising since all reports Indicate that at least a 3 0% 
drop in yield may be expected from one generation of selling* 

The results obtained in this study are not reliable, however, 
because of the variability caused by factors other than those 
under test. Light, temperature and border effect gave a high 
variability, (e.g 0 column mean square in Table 8). The low per¬ 
centage of germination indicates that probably only the most 
vigorous seeds and seedlings were those tested. The few crossed 
seeds occurring in the selfed and machine treatments may have 
been those actually tested, since these would be the most 
vigorous.

The Effect of DDT on Bumble Bees 

Three of the six bees introduced into the cage* 
immediately after the enclosed growth had been dusted, were 
still actively tripping after being caged for five days 0 
Three of the bees were found dead, one the day following in¬ 
troduction and two the second day* 

One bumble bee was found dead two days after the 
introduction into the cage in which the growth had been dusted 
two days prior to introduction of the bees# The other five 
continued to trip flowers and were released five days after 
introduction* 

The bees showed no ill effects from exposure to DDT 
or from their stay in the cages# This preliminary study, 
therefore, indicates that bumble bees are quite tolerant of 
DDT dust# 


Identification of Leaf-Cutter Specimens 


A number of leaf-cutter bees collected in alfalfa fields 

were identified by Mr. C. E. Lilly, Department of Entomology, 

University of Alberta* Of 13 specimens collected, the following 

were found: Megachile ( Xanthosarus ) perihirta Ckll# 6 ?•

SUMMARY 


1* Tripping is almost always a prerequisite to seed setting# 

2# Automatic tripping was of little importance during the 

season of 1950 * The exclusion of tripping and pollinating 
insects reduced the yield by 93^# 

3o Leaf-cutter and bumble bees are the most important trippers 
of alfalfa and their presence is one of the most important 
factors in seed setting of alfalfa under northern Alberta 
conditions# 

k* Honey bees are not important alfalfa trippers in Alberta but 
may increase the amount of automatic tripping that normally 
occurs# 

5# Cross-pollination increased the number of seeds per flower 
seven times, pod setting 2#3 times and the seeds per pod 2#8 
times over self-pollination# 

6# Tripping by caged leaf-cutter bees and bumble bees results 
in cross-pollination# The majority of tripping occurring 
under natural conditions likewise results in cross-pollina¬ 
tion indicating that insects are the main tripping and pollen 
carrying agents in alfalfa fields*

7. The mechanical tripper* proved to be an efficient tripper 
but few pods resulted from the flowers so tripped* The 
higher percentage of the pods that do result are from self- 
pollinated flowers# Seed yields were not increased in 
strips treated with this machine, but the results are not 
considered conclusive# 

8# No significant difference was obtained when forage yield 
of plants growing from seed resulting from different means 
of pollination was compared# 

9# Bumble bees appear to be tolerant of DDT and continue trip¬ 
ping even though flowers are heavily dusted#
