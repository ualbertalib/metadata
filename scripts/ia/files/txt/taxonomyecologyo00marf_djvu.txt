Part I - DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES 


1* Introduction 

In investigating the botanical composition of grass¬ 
lands, it is often necessary to identify plants that are 
in the pre-flowering stage or in a closely grazed condition, 
and, therefore, without inflorescence. In such cases iden¬ 
tification must be based on the vegetative characters of the 
plant* 

Identification of grasses (Gramineae) by means of 
vegetative characters is shown to be practical through the 
work of various authors* Carrier (4), using vegetative 
characters of roots, stems, and various leaf parts, has de¬ 
veloped a key and presented detailed descriptions of forty- 
eight grasses common to th© ©astern part of the United States* 
Nowosad, Swales and Dore (13) present a key for identifica¬ 
tion of thirty-nine grasses of pastures and meadows of 
eastern Canada* This key employs characters of the vegeta¬ 
tive parts, especially those of the leaves, such as sheath, 
auricles, collar, ligule and blade* One-hundred and two 
native and naturalized grasses of the Prairie Provinces 
have been identified in a similar manner.by Clarke, Camp¬ 
bell and Shevkenek (5)* 

In this thesis an attempt is made to utilize vegetative 
characters in a diagnosis of species of Carex, with a view 
to the production of a key for the identification of the

2. Sedges and Grasses contrasted 

Sedges or carices are often distinguishable with dif¬ 
ficulty from grasses. This is especially true of those 
sedges occurring in pastures and meadows. The following 
table sets forth the contrasting vegetative characters op 
Sedges and grasses.

3. Morphology of Carex Leaves 
(a) Leaf ligule 

This is a membranous tissue clasping the culm, 
or bud-shoot, inside the leaf, at the junction of the blade 
and sheath. In all the species studied it is opaque, and 
assumes the form of a fold of membranous tissue which ex¬ 
tends up the culm lbr varying short distances (up to 1.5 
mm.). In most of the sedges studied the ligule is ridge¬ 
like and clasps the culm on the two sides adjacent to the 
leaf-blade and gradually merges with the sheath on the 
third side. In Garex Eleocharis it clasps the culm on all 
three sides in a collar-like manner. 

Thus the ligule of most sedges differs rather markedly 
from the typical grass ligule, in that it is a firm ridge- 
like structure rather than a delicate collar. Moreover, it 
is more persistent than the grass ligule which commonly 
becomes lacerated or otherwise broken down. 

A possible function of these structures Is to prevent 













Mb 






- 9 - 


the intrusion of water and dust particles, and possibly 
fungal spores, between the culm and the leaf-sheath where 
they might have harmful effects. 

(b) Leaf anatomy 

A detailed examination of the Internal struc¬ 
ture of the leaves of the twelve sedge species was carried 
out, as a possible supplement to the us© of larger vegeta™ 
tive characters for diagnostic purposes. Similar studies 
of grasses have been don© by Burr and Turner (1) on 
’’British Economic Grasses’ 1 , and to a lesser extent by 
Nowosad, Swales and Dor© (13) on grasses of pastures and 
meadows of Eastern Canada® 

Transverse sections of typical leaves of each of the 
twelve sedges were cut at approximately one-third of the 
length of the leaf from the basal end. These were stained 
in safranin and mounted in a medium of sixty per cent gly¬ 
cerine, a method recommended by Johansen (9). Detailed 
drawings of these sections are shown, m figs® 1 to 12. 
Though each section Is drawn to scale, the same scale is 
not used throughout, but rather an attempt has been made 
to use a magnification suited to a representation of the 
structural details® 

The cuticle Is indicated by means of a heavy black 
line. Details of epidermal cells are shown, though not 
continued throughout the entire length of the drawing® 

Where cellular detail is not shown a fine black line marks

off the Inner boundary of the epidermis. In all drawings 
detail of motor cells is shown. The mesophyll of these 
leaves consists of three distinct parts. The green coloured 
chlorenchyma which makes up the bulk of the mesophyll is 
shown white. The colorless, large-celled tissue, inter¬ 
preted as water storage tissue, has complete cellular de¬ 
tail indicated. Very little cellular detail of the vas¬ 
cular tissue is indicated, (some 2 or 3 of the larger xylem 
cells being shown). The sclerotic tissue, some strands of 
which are without associated vascular tissue, is stippled 
with fine black dots.

of twelve species of Carex. The approximate magnifications 
of these drawings are shown below.

Figures 1-3 show a view of the leaf section in 
midrib and margin regions of the leaf. In each case a 
distinct break is left to indicate that an intervening 
portion is omitted. 

A small insert in fig. 3 shows a detailed, highly 
magnified pair of asperities of the upper epidermis. 

Similar structures occur on the upper epidermis of several 
of these sedges. In fig. 12 is an insert showing cellular 
detail of the basal portion of on© of the epidermal hairs 
of £. abbrevlata . 

A study of these leaf sections has led to the follow¬ 
ing observations and conclusions. 

On the upper leaf surface of certain sedges there ap¬ 
pear to be rounded, rib-like structures. These are not com¬ 
parable with the ribs of grass leaves as described by Burr 
and Turner (1) but rather are protrusions of th© mesophyll 
between girders of sclerotic tissue in the region of th© 
bundles. Such structures appear in £. phaeocephala . When 
the tissues below the midrib are thickened and strengthened 
the blade is keeled in this region (fig. 4). 

There are two types of epidermal cells© The more or 
less regular cells make up the bulk of the epidermis. Th© 
large thin-walled motor or bulliform ceils are located on 
the upper surface in the region of the midrib. Outgrowths 
from the epidermis occur as trichomes, details of which are 
illustrated In fig. 12, or as short,stiff asperities.

details of which are illustrated in fig. 3. 

The vascular bundles lie in parallel lines running 
from the base to the apex of the leaf* In section they 
appear as a row of isolated units extending from margin 
to margin of the blade. They vary in size and can be 
classified in three orders - midrib, principal and 
secondary. The midrib is not always larger than the 
principal bundles and in most sedges, apart from its 
central position, cannot be distinguished from them. 

Each bundle is surrounded by a well-marked sclerotic 
sheath, and the xylem vessels are well developed in the 
midrib and principal bundles* 

Sclerotic tissue appears in groups or patches. It 
is present near the epidermis of some leaves and in vary¬ 
ing amounts at the keel* It also subtends the vascular 
bundles in isolated patches or links the sclerotic sheath 
to the upper or lower surfaces, thus forming girders which 
stretch partially or entirely across the blade. Whilst 
girdering is more common In the principal bundles it is 
not confined to them. The sclerotic tissue below the 
bundles may spread laterally, as illustrated in fig* 6* 

The mesophyll varies in amount according to the re¬ 
lative thickness of the blade. Certain portions of this 
mesophyll, usually between the bundles and in the central 
regions of the blade are devoid of chlorophyll* It is 
suggested that this may be water storage tissue.

Great similarity is exhibited in the general appear¬ 
ance of these sections. Differences do appear between 
certain of the species. The presence of epidermal hairs 
on £. abb rev iata is unique for the twelve species. As¬ 
perities are quite corrmon on the upper epidermis of several 
of these sedges. The leaf outlines of £. filifolia and 
£. Eleocharis differ from the others. But in all cases 
these differences are easily perceived, especially with 
the aid of a hand lens. It appears therefore that the 
information obtainable through the time-consuming prepara¬ 
tion of leaf sections is of relatively little value for 
diagnostic purposes, and not sufficient to warrant the use 
of this procedure in species determination* 

4. Detailed Descriptions of Twelve Carex Species 

I. Carex obtusata Lilj. 

A short, slender plant found on nearly all 
the drier grasslands, rarely found on lower, wetter areas. 
Usual height from 6 to 12 cm. Leaf blades 1 to 1.5 mm. 
wide, with prominent, entire, ridge-like ligules* 

Has a long, slender, lustrous, purple rhizome covered 
with numerous fine bracts. Depth of rhizome varies with 
soil conditions. Often found growing in close association 
with £. heliophila which has a deeper rhizome. 

The aerial shoots arise from the nodes of the rhizome 
as single shoots 1 to 2 cm. apart. These aerial shoots

have a series of bracts, larger and coarser than those of 
the rhizome. 



II. Carex siccata Dewey. 

A relatively robust upland sedge. It exhibits 
considerable variation in habitat, but usually grows on the 
lower or wetter areas of the uplands, such as in shallow 
depressions, or north-facing slopes. Usual height is from 
2 to 4 dm. The leaf-blades are from 2 to 3 mm. wide, with 
a narrow ridge-like ligule with very slightly lacerate mar- 
gba. 

Has a coarse well-developed rhizome, stramineous to 
light brown in colour. The depth of the rhizome varies 
with soil conditions. The bract scales of the rhizome 
and underground parts of the aerial shoots are large and 
well developed. The aerial shoots arise from the nodes 
of the rhizome as single shoots 1 to 6 cm. apart.

Part II - ECOLOGICAL STUDIES 


Introduction 

Studies on the proportion of sedges in relation to 
grasses and other leading species of grassland associa¬ 
tions were carried out in two widely separated regions 
of Alberta during the summer months of 1948 and 1949. 

The investigation of 1948 was in connection with general 
botanical field work in the Peace River region. The 1949 
investigation was in connection with a range survey car¬ 
ried out by the Eastern Rockies Forest Conservation Board, 
in that part of the Rocky Mountain Forest Reserve known 
as the Crowsnest Forest. 

Both investigations were accomplished by general re¬ 
connaissance* and by critical studies of localized areas* 
including quadrats. The 1948 survey of the Peace River 
region of Alberta was essentially a botanical survey. The 
1949 survey of the Crowsnest Forest region of south-western 
Alberta was essentially an inventory of resources useful 
for range management purposes. Associated with these dif¬ 
ferences in general aim of the two surveys there were some 
differences in methods of sampling and recording. 

A. Peace River Survey 
1. Methods

was recorded in the form of a species list of all the higher

plants and their prevalence as determined by detailed 
studies. The sampling method used was a modified form of 
the "Percentage Area Method of Pasture Analysis" as out¬ 
lined by E. Wyllie Fenton (8) and by Tinney, Aamodt and 
Ahlgren (15). Quadrat samples were recorded for three 
grassland areas in the Grande Prairie section of the 
Peace River region. The first of these areas was a relict 
type located in a cemetery and a small adjacent area which 
had been relatively undisturbed and probably very close to 
the virgin condition. This area was some two miles south 
and three miles west' of Sexsmith, on the old "Emerson 
Trail". Here thirty quadrats, three decimeters square 
(nine square dm. per quadrat), were recorded along a line 
transect of the area, the quadrats spaced nine meters a- 
part. The coverage of each species was estimated to the 
nearest one per cent and recorded for each quadrat. 

The second area was a very infrequently used horse 
pasture which approximated very closely the virgin condi¬ 
tion. This area was some four miles north and eleven miles 
east of Grande Prairie. Thirty quadrats were laid out and 
recorded as for the first area. About half a mile west of 
this area a third area was investigated in a pasture that 
had been heavily grazed by both horses and cattle. Here 
fifteen quadrats were studied. 

These three areas have very similar topography and 
were selected for more intensive study because they ap-

peared to best represent a relatively undisturbed native 
grassland and the effects of be^cxv^j grazing. 

Formal citations of the species recorded for these 
areas are found in the Appendix. 


2. Results and Analysis 

The quadrat records of the three areas studied 
are shown in Tables I, II and III. In addition to the fifty 
species recorded for the first area and listed in Table I, 
fourteen others were observed within the area. While these 
fourteen species were of rather rare occurrence and seem 
to have little or no bearing on the analyses, they are 
listed below as part of the record.

The number of quadrats required to give an adequate 
sample is determined by use of a species-area curve® This 
is a characteristic curve which results from plotting the 
number of species found against the quadrats sampled (14)* 
The accumulated number of species recorded for the quadrats 
is expressed as an absolute number and plotted on the y 
axis and the corresponding quadrat numbers are arranged on 
the x axis. The curve formed by the joined points rises 
abruptly with the earlier increases in total sample area. 


but soon levels off, and tends to rise only slightly there-

after with increases of sampling area. For any type of 
vegetation the sampling is assumed to be adequate when 
the size of the sample somewhat exceeds the number of 
quadrats corresponding to the point at which the curve 
flattens strongly. 

If the total number of species obtained in the samp¬ 
ling is divided by the total number of sample units 
(quadrats), the average increment of new species per ad¬ 
ditional sample unit is obtained. In Table 1 the average 
increment is fifty divided by thirty or 1.67 new species 
per quadrat. On the species-area curve, point A locates 
the position where addition of a unit sample produces an 
increment of 1.67 species (the average increment). Be¬ 
yond this point addition of samples will yield progres¬ 
sively less than the average. In the region of point B 
a sample yields only one-half the information, i.e. an 
increment of 0.83 species per additional s ample. In the 
region of point C a sample yields one-quarter of the in¬ 
formation, i.e. 0.41 species per additional sample* In 
the accompanying species— area graph, point A occurs at 
10, point B at 14 and point C at 16 quadrats. 

A similar analysis for Table II has shown the samp¬ 
ling for the corresponding area is also more than adequate. 
The fifteen quadrats taken in the third area and shown in 
Table III are also adequate for average increments of 
species (point A) and for half the average increments of 
species (point B) but not adequate for one-quarter of the

average increments of species (point C). It is, however, 
quite a suitable sample of the grassland for the purpose 
of the present study* 

Analyses of these three areas are further presented in 
accordance with the procedure of Braun-Blanquet, summarized 
by Oosting (14) and by Cain (2)* Involved are three quanti¬ 
tative analytical concepts pertaining to the organization of 
a plant community. These concepts are concerned with the 
number of plants, the coverage, and the uniformity of dis¬ 
tribution and are known respectively as abundance, dominance 
and frequency. 

Abundance is an appreciation of the relative number of 
individuals of each species entering into the constitution 
of the plant population of the territory under study. A 
scale of five degrees of abundance is suggested by Braun- 
Blanquet. 

A 1 - species very rare in the community 

A 2 - species rare in the community 

A 3 - species not very abundant in the 
c ommunit y 

A 4 - species abundant in the community 

A 5 - species very abundant in the community 

Dominance concerns the extent (surface and volume) 
covered or occupied by the individuals of each species. A 
scale of five degrees of dominance is used here. 

Do 1 - species covering 1 to 5 % of the surface 

Do 2 - species covering 6 to 25$ of the surface 







35 


Do 3 - species covering 26 to 50$ of the surface 

Do 4 - species covering 51 to 75$ of the surface 

Do 5 - species covering 76 to 100$ of the surface 

Frequency is concerned with the uniformity with which 
the plants of a species are distributed throughout a plant 
community* The frequency of a species is expressed by the 
relation in per cent between the number of sample areas 
which contained it and the total number of such areas em¬ 
ployed in the analysis. Frequency is usually expressed on 
a basis of five classes. 

FI- species in 1 to 20$ of the quadrats 
F 2 - species in 21 to 40$ of the quadrats 

F 3 - species in 41 to 60$ of the quadrats 

F 4 - species in 61 to 80$ of the quadrats 

F 5 - species in 81 to 100$ of the quadrats 

The percentage is called the frequency-index” of the species. 

It is important to recognize the essential distinctness 
of the three concepts: number (abundance), area of coverage 
(dominance), and homogeneity (frequency). Accordingly a sum¬ 
mary in terms of quantitative concepts relating to the 
species composing the three grassland communities of the 
Peace River for which data is available has been drawn up 
and is presented here.

Observations of other areas in this region indicate 
that the 15$ cover of shrubs in Table I is higher than that 
for most areas. The shrub cover in Tables II and III are 
probably somewhat too low for typical grassland of the region* 

The effect of grazing in the third area (Table III) 
appears to be a marked reduction in grasses accompanied by 
an increase in sedges and bare ground. Similar proportions 
of forbs for the three areas indicate that grazing of the 
third area had not yet brought about an Increase in these 
plants. It seems probable, from observations of other 
overgrazed areas in the region, and from results obtained 
elsewhere by other investigators, that some of the bare 
ground in the third area will be invaded eventually by forbs* 
The quadrat studies and general observations indicate that 
Antennaria spp *, Pulsatilla ludovieiana , Solidago decumbens. 

Orthocarpus luteua , and Artemisia frigida are increasing. 

These will probably form the main cover of the bare ground, 
if present grazing pressure is maintained. 

While the proportion of forbs in this he a Vi /y 
grazed area (Table III) is not increased, the grasses show 
a marked reduction over their occurrence in the slightly 
utilized areas, while the sedges exhibit a corresponding 
increase. This contrast points to the conclusion that 
species of Carex (in this instance, chiefly G. heliophila 
and C. obtusata ) may serve as indicators of early stages in 
retrogression of native grassland, even in advance of such 
indicators as Artemisia frig id a .

B. Crowsnest Forest Survey 

1. Methods 


This survey was more general in nature than 
that of the Peace River. The list indicating the floristic 
composition is thus not nearly so detailed, often only in¬ 
cluding generic names. The rugged topography of the Crows- 
nest forest area results in a great variation in vegetation 
types within very short distances- In a region with such 
a diversity of vegetation an area was ’’typed** according to 
the plants giving the appearance or physiognomy. This pro¬ 
cedure resulted on the recognition of ten vegetation types. 

1. Grassland - includes all grassland other than meadows. 

2. Meadow - includes areas where moisture-loving sedges, 

rushes and grasses predominate. Two 
classes are recognized: 

(a) Wet Meadows characterized by sedges 
and rushes, and remaining wet through¬ 
out the year. 

(b) Dry Meadow s as found in timber or 
along streams. 

3. Perennial forbs - included untimbered areas where 

perennial weeds predominate. 

4. Sagebrush - includes untimbered areas where sagebrush 

gives the aspect. 

5. Browse - includes lands where shrubs predominate. 

6. Conifers - all coniferous stands except juniper. There 

may be an understory of grass, weeds or 
browse• 

7. Waste - includes all areas which have little or no 

forage value due to density of standing 
or down timber, sparseness of forage, or 
rough and inaccessible.

8. Barren - includes bed rock, shale, sand dunes or areas 

that normally bear no forage. 

9. Broadleaf trees - includes deciduous timber, mainly 

cottonwood, aspen or birch. 

10. Annuals - annual weeds or grasses. Bromus tectorum is 

the most common sub-type. 

Each type was delimited by use of aerial photographs 
and inspection of the areas. After each type was delimited 
and classified it was sampled. 

The sampling method employed in this survey is a modi¬ 
fied version of a "reconnaissance 11 method based on a belt 
transection (transect) three feet wide and as long as the 
distance walked. This "reconnaissance" method is described 
in the Range Management Handbook for Region One of the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture Forest Service (10). The modified 
method is based on a series of plots located on a transect 
through the type. The number of plots varies according to 
the variations within the type, ten being taken as the base 
number, and the use of more or fewer being left to the 
judgment of the examiner. The transect is a meandering one 
with location left entirely to the judgment of the examiner. 
It should aim to include variations but the main part should 
cut through the average of the type. The sample plots are 
located at random along the transect, each being an area 
easily observed by the examiner and if feasible almost dir¬ 
ectly beneath him. Usually the plot is circular and ap¬ 
proximately three feet in diameter. The field examiner en¬ 
deavours to make m accurate estimate of the composition.

average density, and other features of the type. Records 
are made of plant species believed to be important because 
of abundance, palatability, poisonous or noxious properties 
or because of their value as indicators of range condition 
and trend. Species that form less than one per cent of the 
composition are not significant for range management and 
need not be listed. The density of the vegetation is esti¬ 
mated in tenths and represented as such. An area that has 
fifty per cent of the ground covered is a 0.50 density. 
Plant composition as used in range surveys is a percentage 
expression of the density of each of the three classes of 
forage (grass, weeds and browse) and also of the species 
within each class. The totals are one-hundred per cent in 
both cases. The total percentage composition of the grass 
species, for example, must therefore equal the percentage 
composition for grass cover. 

Density and composition estimates are made looking 
vertically at the ground. Care is required in estimating 
density of open clumps of grass, shrubs or spreading weeds 
to include only those parts that obscure the ground when 
viewed vertically and when spreading plants are bunched at 
an angle of thirty degrees from the vertical® Only the 
leafage and tips of trees and coarse shrubs clearly with¬ 
in reach of livestock enter into the estimate. The density 
of two-story vegetation, such as grass beneath shrubs, is 
estimated as for one-story vegetation with no allowance 
for overlap. These methods of judging reconnaissance den-

sities are further explained by the illustrations on the 
density chart shown on page 48* Heavily grazed vegetation 
is visualized in the%tilized condition and so estimated. 

It is generally desirable to estimate composition by 
rating the species in accordance with their relative abun¬ 
dance in the type, starting with the most abundant species* 

It may be necessary to adjust individual initial ratings to 
make them total one-hundred per cent* 

The foregoing method of range sampling depends almost 
entirely upon the judgment of the examiner. Accuracy in 
judgment and uniformity of judgment among the members of a 
field party is of first importance. Such uniformity is ob¬ 
tained by use of a training period at the beginning of the 
field season* Field examiners must demonstrate their ability 
to judge density uniformly with the chief of party before be¬ 
ing permitted to work individually. This uniformity is es¬ 
sential if the data secured by the party are to be reliable 
and usable* 

Of the many types of vegetation sampled during this sur¬ 
vey only the record of one, the Festuca scabre11a type, is 
presented here. This is a grassland with a number of sedge 
species. From the many records of areas belonging to this 
type seven have been selected as representative. These sam¬ 
ple areas fall into two major categories which may be desig¬ 
nated as A and B. Category A is represented by six Festuca 
scabrelia areas that have been subjected to varying degrees 


or intensities of grazing. The recorded coverage of these

areas are set forth in Tables IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX. 
Category B is represented by one area, - a steep, south¬ 
facing hillside which has been severely overgrazed for many 
years. The virgin vegetation was probably a Festuca scabrell a 
association, but the current aspect is that of Carex hello - 
phila . During the previous summer a small plot of about two 
acres was enclosed by a tbree-strand barbed wire fence to 
exclude livestock. A sample taken from this exclosure is con¬ 
trasted with one taken from outside. The records, together 
with more detailed descriptions of each, appear in Tables X 
and XI. 

2. Results and Analyses 

The records of the eight areas are presented in 
Tables IV to XI inclusive. They include the names of plants 
which occupy 1 % or more of the total cover and some addition¬ 
al plants which occupy less than 1 % of the total cover. 

These are listed as a trace (T). The total amount of plant 
cover is recorded as a density, the meaning of which has been 
given (page 47). The species comprising the plant cover are 
arranged in three groups, viz. gramincids, shrubs and forbs• 

Tables IV to IX show the records of sis ^ Festuca scab - 
re 11a M grassland areas (Category A). The compositions of 
these areas are recorded in the tables as percentage of total 
cover.

the floor and steep lower slopes of a mountain valley* The 
precipitous nature of the lower reaches of the valley ren¬ 
der the region practically inaccessible to domestic stock* 

The valley floor has a very good covering of grass, almost 
entirely Festuca scabrella , its density being approximately 
0*75* The cover thins out rapidly on the steeper slopes 
and this greatly reduces the over-all density of the area* 

The Carex population increases with steepness of slope and 
is mainly C. siccata and G. obtusata , with some C* heliophila* 
The vegetation density of this area is 0*40. Thus 60$ of 
the ground surface is without cover. The plant cover of the 


remaining 40$ consists of the following*

This is the record of a vin gin grassland occupying a 
steep south-facing slope and the floor of a mountain valley. 
The lower valley is impassable to livestock. The steepness 
of the slope markedly reduces the average density of the 
cover. The valley floor is estimated to have a density of 
0.80. The Carex population is mostly C. obtusata , with some 
C. siccata and G, heliophila . The vegetation density of the 
area is 0.35. Thus 65$ of the ground surface is without 
cover. The plant cover of the remaining 35$ consists of

Table VII 

This records a well used area showing little evidence of 
overgrazing. At the date of sampling the herbage was grazed 
off most of the area to the extent that the cattle had moved 
to the lower regions among the open poplar stands. The lat¬ 
ter showed little evidence of use up to that time (July 16). 
The area is more or less isolated from the rest of the 
Reserve by mountain slopes and movement of livestock to and 
from the area is carried out by trailing them through the 
Reserve fence and down a creek valley. Due to these barriers 
drifting of livestock is at a minimum in the area and thus a 
definite number of animals can be (and is) maintained. This 
is one of the areas of the Reserve which was considered to 
be properly used. The vegetative density of the area is 0.25. 
Thus about 75^ of the area is bare ground. The plant cover 
of the remaining 25^ is as follows.

Table VIII 

This is a record of grasslands on the lower terraces of 
the Castle river. Due to presence of salting grounds, wat¬ 
ering places, and surrounding steep hills, the cattle tend 
to overgraze these areas to the exclusion of the higher 
benches and hillsides. The area shows the effects of over- 
grazing. The bunches of Festuoa seabrella are greatly re¬ 
duced in size and number, and their place is being taken by 
Stipa spp . and Danthonia intermedia. Small bunches of Poten - 
tilla fruticosa are common over the entire area. At the date 
of the survey (June 28) the grasses had been grazed quite 
close to the ground, with the exception of Danthonia inter¬ 
media . This gave the appearance of a greater proportion of 
Danthonia than actually occurred. The vegetative density of 
this area is 0.45. Thus 55% of the area is bare ground. The

Table IX 

This is a record of exposed south-facing river terraces 
with good grass coverage. Evidence that this area has been 
overgrazed for a number of years is shown by the reduction of 
Festuca scabreila and increase in Stipa spp . Moreover, the 
grass cover is being replaced by a cover of forbs. Garex 
heliophila is the principal sedge, with 0. obtusat a quite 
common. C. siccata and 0. xerantlca are also present in low¬ 
er areas. The density here is 0.40. Thus 60$ of the area 
is bare. The composition of the 40$ plant cover is as follows•

overgrazed for many years. Similar habitats in the region 
usually support a Festuca scabrella type. Moreover, small 
quantities of Festuca scabrella and Festuca idahoensls are 
present in the area, indicating that a Festuca scabrella 
association was present in pre-grazing times. A small part 
of this area was exclosed to domestic stock one year previous 
to the sampling. Table X presents records of a sample taken

0arex heliophila is the principal sedge. Inside the 
exclosure the plants are about twice the size of those out¬ 
side. In fact, this is true for all the graminoids* The 
ground cover of Carex increases by 50$ on the inside of the 
exclosure. This is revealed when the percentage composition 
is multiplied by the density. Thus, 25$ of G. heliophila 


at density of 0*10 gives a factor of .0250 for the outside.

while 15/o of C, heliophila at density of 0.25 gives a factor 
of 0.375 for the inside. Though Artemisia frlglda is very 
rare throughout the entire region, it comprises a consider¬ 
able proportion of the shrub cover in this area.

as well as proportions of forbs and of shrubs may serve to 
indicate varying degrees of grazing intensity in native 
grassland. An earlier summary (page 66) shows the sedges 
principally associated with overgrazing in the region are 
Carex heliophila and C. obtusata . 

Discuss ion 

The grassland sites described in this thesis have 
been selected to show the harmful effects of man’s activities 
upon them. In both regions the native grassland t^as been so 
disturbed that little of it presents a virgin or nearly 
virgin aspect* except certain relict areas which for var¬ 
ious reasons have escaped modifying influences. In the main 
these changes have come as an indirect result of man f s ac¬ 
tivities, in the form of overgrazing by livestock. Other 
causal factors include fire and cultivation. The areas of 
virgin grassland studied have become relicts by reason of 
their isolation from grazing animals* either because of 
topographic barriers or through the use of exclosures. 

The usual effect of overgrazing a grassland community 
is a progressive decrease in abundance and vigor of the 
more palatable species of grasses, associated with a cor¬ 
responding increase in unpalatable species of weeds and, 
sometimes shrubs. Such results have been reported by 
Clarke, Tisdale, and Skoglund (6); Moss and Campbell (12)? 
Moss (11); and Tisdale (17).

The earlier stages of destruction through overgrazing 
of grassland are detected by various methods. One of these 
methods is by the use of indicators. This method lends it¬ 
self readily to observation and reconnaissance, and for this 
reason is popular. However, warnings against the indis¬ 
criminate use of this procedure have been given by several 
investigators. Clarke, Tisdale, and Skoglund (6) advise 
that considerable caution be used in interpreting abundance 
of unpalatable species as indicative of overgrazing because 
of the strong influence of climatic fluctuations. The 
grazing history of the areas described in this thesis is 
well known,and is such that evidence of retrogression in the 
areas may be attributed to the effects of overgrazing rather 
than to climate. 

The principal grasses of the virgin grasslands in the 
Feace River are gtipa spp . and Agropyron trachycaulum . These 
become greatly reduced in quantity in heavily grazed areas. 

At the same time, a less palatable grass, Danthonia intermedl a, 
becomes the leading grass species. The total coverage of 
grasses is reduced from 66% to 58%> while the sedge cover in¬ 
creases from 11% to 28% (page 43)* 

In southwestern Alberta the virgin grasslands consist 
mainly of two species of fescue. The taller species, Festuca 
scabrella , usually grows in huge bunches up to one foot in 
diameter. Growing in the spaces between these large tussocks 
are found the smaller bunches of Festuca idahoensls . This 


condition exists only under very light grazing. Increase in

grazing intensity results in decrease in size of the F. 
scabrella bunches. This reduction in size progresses with 
increasing grazing pressure until small tufts of F, scabrella 
result. This reduction in size of clumps of F. scabrella 
increases the area of bare ground which is apparently then 
invaded by forbs and shrubs and some less palatable species 
of grasses. Further overgrazing results in reduction in 
numbers of both species of fescue as well as a reduction in 
size of the F. idahoensis . Finally the rough fescue (F. 
scabrella ) disappears and only small remnants of F. idahoensi s 
occur. By this time certain other grasses, notably Danthonia 
spp . and Agropyron spp . have increased considerably. 

Results of studies on grassland areas, contained in 
the summary on page 68, have been arranged to show the ef¬ 
fects of progressively increased grazing pressure, beginning 
with the study of a virgin grassland reported in Table IV 
and ending with the greatly modified grassland reported in 
Table X. The grass cover ranges from a high of 75^ (composed, 
largely of the two highly paLatable fescue species), to a low 
of 2&%> (composed largely of Agropyron spp .and containing no 
fescues). The shrubs and forbs meanwhile increase from a 
low of 20% to a high of 50$. 

Accompanying these great changes in vegetative cover 
are increase in numbers of certain species of plants (among 
many others) which have come to be regarded as indicators of 
retrogression. The more important of these are Danthonia spp. f

Potent ilia fruticosa and Artemisia frigida * 

Rtentilia fruticosa has not been reported from the 
Peace River area. Artemisia frigid a is not reported In our 
studies of the nearly virgin grasslands of that region, 
but occurs in the heavily grazed area in even greater quan¬ 
tities than is indicated by the quadrat studies. Quadrat 
results in the first area (Table I) report D, Intermedia as 
making up 4.5$ of the cover. Studies in the second area, 
which is nearly virgin though subject to some winter graz¬ 
ing by horses, reports D. intermedia covering 21$ of the 
area. The intensely grazed pasture area reported in Table 
III shows D. intermed 1 a occupying 20.5$ of the area. Pro¬ 
bably the factor of winter grazing has a marked effect upon 
the amount of D, intermedia , which may explain the increase 
of its cover on the second area* 

Danthonia spp ., Artemisia frigida , and Potent ilia 
fruticosa are reported in the studies of grassland areas in 
the Crowsnest Forest region. The results (Tables IV-XI) show 
that P. fruticosa makes up less than 1$ of the total cover. 
Observations of other overgrazed grasslands in the region 
indicate that this shrub increases with heavy grazing. Moss 
and J. A. Campbell (12), in a study of Festuca scab re 11a 
grasslands, state that P. fruticosa increases with grazing. 

J. B. Campbell (3), in a study of grasslands of the Crov/s- 
nest Forest region, shov/s a definite increase in ?. fruticosa 
in overgrazed areas. It seems therefore that ?. fruticosa

may be regarded as an indicator of overgrazed condition in 
grasslands of this region. In the present investigation 
Danthonia spp . are shown (Tables IV - XI) to increase from 
less than 1% in the virgin grasslands (Table IV) to 10% in 
the overgrazed area (Table IX). Artemisia frigida also shows 
an increase from less than 1% in the virgin grasslands (Table 
IV) to 15% in the heavily overgrazed area (Table XI). Prom 
these results it seems that Danthonia 3pp. and A. frigida 
may also be regarded as Indicators of overgrazed condition 
in grasslands of this region. This is in accord with the 
conclusions of earlier investigators in the region (3, 11, 

12 ). 

Results of studies of Peace River grasslands show that 
sedges increase from 11% in the virgin grassland (Table II) 
to 28% in the Aea.v'cly grazed grassland (Table III). Re¬ 
sults of studies of Growsnest Forest grasslands show that 
sedges increase from 2% in the virgin grassland (Table IV) 
to 25% in the heavily grazed grassland (Table X). This in¬ 
crease in sedge cover begins to show at a very early stage 
of overgrazing and continues until the sedges make up nearly 
all of the available forage in a heavily grazed area. 

It seems probable, from observations of the area re¬ 
ported in Tables X and XI, and from observations of other 
overgrazed areas in the region, that the reduced vegetative, 
cover resulting from overgrazing may lead to an increase in 
erosion sufficient to cause an unstable soil condition. Re¬ 
duction of the vegetative cover through overgrazing repre-

sents a retrogression towards a more primitive condition. 
Ramaley (15), in a study of the role of sedges in some 
Colorado plant communities, states that sedges exist 
chiefly in primitive communities or unstable soil situa¬ 
tions. The conditions are the direct results of overgraz¬ 
ing and provide a favourable habitat for extension of 
sedge cover. 

This increase in sedge cover may be further explained 
in terms of the reproductive features of the plants them¬ 
selves. The sedges involved are mainly C. heliophila and 
C. obtusat a , both of which begin growth very early in the 
season, and produce flowering stalks and seed much earlier 
than the grasses. Observations in early June showed that 
these sedges had ripened seed before extensive spring 
grazing of the grassland had taken place. In addition to 
early maturation of seed these sedges have another means 
of reproduction, namely long, fast-growing rhizomes that 
enable these plants to invade denuded areas and to com¬ 
pete effectively with other species. 

The most important conclusions of this study of Al¬ 
berta grasslands are: (1) that certain sedges, C. obtusata 
and C. heliophila, increase appreciably even under moderate 
grazing; (2) that these species may be used as indicators 
of slight grazing intensity, whereas, such commonly re¬ 
cognized indicator species as Potent ilia fruticosa and 










75 


Artemisia frlgida become useful only in advanced stages 
of overgrazing. 










SUMMARY 


The first part of this thesis deals with diagnostic 
features of grassland species of Carex. A table showing 
contrasting vegetative characters of sedges and grasses is 
presented. The morphology of the sedge leaf is discussed 
with special reference to the ligule and the anatomy of the 
leaf blade. Descriptions of twelve species of Carex in¬ 
clude information on growth characteristics, features of 
their subterranean parts and occurrence in Alberta. A key 
for the identification of these twelve sedge species is 
presented. This key, based on external features of the 
leaves, crowns and underground organs, should prove useful 
in rangeland studies involving records of the herbage cover. 

The second part of the thesis is concerned with ecologi¬ 
cal studies of the sedges. Records of detailed studies in 
two widely separated rangelands of Alberta are tabulated and 
summarized. A consideration of the amount and importance of 
sedge cover in relation to grasses and other leading species 
of the rangeland is directed towards contrasting the virgin 
or nearly virgin parts of grasslands with those subjected 
to varying intensities of grazing. The use of certain plants 
as indicators of overgrazed conditions is discussed. The 
following conclusions are drawn: 

1. Retrogression due to overgrazing is commonly 
evidenced by a reduction in size and numbers of the leading.

more palatable, species and by an increase of the unpalatable 
ones* 

2* Certain of these unpalatable species can be used as 
indicators of retrogression, but usually they become apparent 
only after the grassland has become severely depleted* Some 
of the more important of these indicator plants are Danthonla 
spp *, Potentilla fruticosa , and Artemisia frigida * 

3. Certain species of Carex extend rapidly in numbers 
and coverage with increased grazing pressure* This study 
discloses that these species may be used as indicators of 
early retrogression, well in advance of serious depletion of 
the rangeland through heavy grazing*
