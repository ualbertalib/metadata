SYNOPSIS 


Six hundred operational troops of the 
Canadian Army completed the Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Inventory immediately prior to their 
participation in Exercise SWEETBRIAR, a mock battle 
in the Yukon. At the conclusion of the Exercise, 
each individual was rated on a five point scale 

BY HIS SUPERVISING OFFICER. 

A TEST PROFILE FOR THE CANADIAN SOLDIER 
IS FIRST ESTABLISHED. A COMPARISON IS THEN MADE 
BETWEEN MEAN PROFILES OF THE VARIOUS GROUPS 
RESULTING FROM THE RATINGS. A DIFFERENT BREAKDOWN 
IS ACHIEVED BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL INTO TWO GROUPS, 
ONE CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF INFANTRY, OR COMBATANT 
TROOPS; THE OTHER COMPOSED OF THE REMAINING CORPS, 
LARGELY TRADESMEN AND SERVICE TROOPS. 

fT IS FOUND THAT INEVITABLY THE LOW- 
GRADED GROUP IS THE HIGH SCORING GROUP. HOWEVER 
ALL CANADIAN TROOPS APPEAR LOW ON THE NEUROTIC 
SCALES, HS, D AND HY, AND HIGH ON PD, Sc AND MA 
SCALES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT PRESENT SCREENING 
METHODS IN THE CANADIAN ARMY TEND TO CULL OUT 
POTENTIAL NEUROTICS. THIS DIFFERS FROM AVAILABLE 
INFORMATION CONCERNING MMP I RESULTS WITH AMERICAN 


TROOPS

Although the Exercise did not last long 


ENOUGH TO ATTRIBUTE RESULTING MALADJUSTMENT ENTIRELY 

to Northern service conditions, it becomes apparent 

THAT DIFFICULTIES IN MAINTAINING OPERATIONS IN THE 

North demand enquiry into the possibility of even 

SMALL REDUCTION IN THE WASTAGE AND DETERIORATION 
OF MANPOWER. 

Results of the study suggest that a person 

ALITY TEST MIGHT BE DEVISED WHICH, COMBINED WITH A 
CLINICAL INTERVIEW, WOULD SHARPEN SELECTION TECH- 
NIQUES. 

There is apparently a worth-while field 

FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 


Many people have assisted in connection 

WITH THIS STUDY AND I SHOULD LIKE NOW TO EXPRESS 
MY GRATITUDE AND APPRECIATION FOR THEIR HELP. 

Major-General M.H.S. Penhale, MBE, ED, 
General Officer Commanding, Western Command, Can¬ 
adian Army, kindly gave permission for the testing 
of Exercise SWEETBRIAR personnel during the concen¬ 
tration period at Wainwright, Alberta. He also 
allowed the use of officer ratings as the criterion 
for the project. 

Colonel George Weir, Chief Administration 
Officer for the Canadian Army component of SWEETBR1AR 

WAS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE 
REQUIRED PERSONNEL AND IN STIMULATING REPLIES TO 
RATING SHEET QUERIES. 

Misses Helen McWilliams and Olga Barilko, 

POST-GRADUATE STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, 
WERE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN THE COMPILATION OF STAT¬ 
ISTICS. 

The SPECIAL AID AND SKILLFUL DIRECTION 

given by Dr. D. E. Smith of the University of 
Alberta has been stimulating and indispensable. 

His personal liaison with Dr. W. Morton of Defence 
Research Board, and Dr. S.R. Hathaway of the Univ-

ersity of Minnesota has provided material which 

BROADENED THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT. WITHOUT DR . 
SMITH*S ENCOURAGEMENT AND HELPFUL CRITICISM THIS 
WORK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. 

The Defence Research Board assisted 

GREATLY BY PROVIDING FUNDS TO TAKE CARE OF THE 
LABORIOUS DETAIL OF SCORING ANSWER SHEETS. 

Finally, ! am indeed grateful to Can¬ 
adian Army authorities, and through them to the 
Department of National Defence, for financing my 
post-graduate studies during the past year. It is 

HOPED THAT THE PRESENT DISSERTATION WILL HAVE SOME 
PRACTICAL VALUE TO THE SERVICE IN POINTING UP AREAS 
WHERE IMPROVED TECHNIQUES ARE POSSIBLE AND FURTHER 
RESEARCH DESIRABLE.

INTRODUCTION 

Stat eme nt of the Problem; 

Currently there is much interest in the effect 
of "the North", as such on individuals who for some 

REASON FIND THEMSELVES LIVING THERE. A UNIQUE OPPOR¬ 
TUNITY AROSE DURING FEBRUARY, 195°> T0 STUDY A LARGE 
GROUP OF MEN WHO WERE DETAILED TO LIVE IN THE NORTH 
FOR A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS. THE CANADIAN 

Army in conjunction with United States forces, undertook 

AN OPERATIONAL TASK CALLED EXERCISE SWEETBRIAR. 

Aside from the direct training of troops 

WHICH RESULTS FROM SUCH ACTIVITY, A MAJOR PURPOSE WAS 
TO OBSERVE SCIENTIFICALLY THE EFFECT ON MEN AND EQUIP¬ 
MENT CAUSED BY, AND THE MODIFICATION IN TACTICS 
REQUIRED BY, THE RIGOROUS ENVIRONMENT. THE MAIN 
PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN BY THE AGD OF THE 

U.S. Army, and the complete report on the Exercise has 

BEEN PUBLISHED JOINTLY BY THE TWO ARMIES, (l) 

The Defence Research Board arranged, through 
the Department of Philosophy and Psychology of the 
University of Alberta, for a special observation of 
Canadian personnel with regard to their adjustment 
under Northern service conditions. The project was 
necessarily small, and conclusive results were not

EXPECTED. This is a report on the study which was made. 

The Canadian Soldier as an individual shows 

MUCH VARIABILITY IN HIS EFFICIENCY, MOTIVATION AND 
PERSONAL SATISFACTION WITHIN THE WELL-I NTEGRATED TEAM 
WHICH CONSTITUTES THE CANADIAN ARMY ACTIVE FORCE. 

Careful selection devices in Personnel Depots where 

APPLICANTS ENTER THE ARMY ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THE ACCEP¬ 
TANCE OF ONLY HIGH QUALITY POTENTIAL SOLDIERS. PHYSICAL 
AND MENTAL ABILITY IS DETERMINED IN A VERY WORKABLE 
AND SATISFACTORY MANNER, BUT THE PERSONALITY OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL IS BARELY SCRUTINIZED IN A CURSORY ATTEMPT 
TO MATCH THE FUNCTIONING COMPOSITE OF PHYSIQUE AND 
INTELLECT TO THE ENVIRONMENT OF A SOLDIER. THIS 
SITUATION RESULTS FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SIMPLE 
STANDARD WAY OF DESCRIBING PERSONALITY IN TERMS WHICH 
PERMIT MATCHING AGAINST JOB REQUIREMENTS, AND FURTHER, 
THERE HAS BEEN NO ANALYSIS OF ARMY REQUIREMENTS IN 
TERMS OF PERSONALITY. |T IS USUALLY DIFFICULT THERE¬ 
FORE, TO SHOW WHY AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MEETS PHYSICAL 
AND MENTAL STANDARDS, AND WHO ENLISTED VOLUNTARILY, 

FAILS TO ACHIEVE SATISFACTORY ADJUSTMENT. THIS AREA 
THEN, APPEARED A LOGICAL STARTING POINT FOR SPECIFIC 
STUDY DURING THE SPECIAL PERIOD OF THE EXERCISE.

Since the last war, much emphasis has been 

PLACED ON THE ROLE OF THE CANADIAN ARMY AS THE EXPERT 

in Northern warfare. However, although most personnel 

ARE ACCUSTOMED TO COLD WEATHER, CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH 
IS NECESSARY BEFORE EVEN CANADIANS CAN PERFORM SUCCESS¬ 
FULLY in the North. Living conditions as they effect 

THE INDIVIDUAL ARE RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE USUAL, 
AND IT IS A QUESTION WHETHER MEN PHYSICALLY AND MEN¬ 
TALLY FIT, CAN BE DETAILED FOR DUTY IN SUCH AN 
ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT A FURTHER CAREFUL SCREENING WITH 
REGARD TO PERSONALITY. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO HELP 
SECURE AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. 

In BRIEF, IT ATTEMPTS TO DI SCOVER AMONG 
TRAINED OPERATIONAL TROOPS, PERSONALITY FACTORS WHICH 


ARE SIGNIFICANTLY PRESENT IN 

THOSE I ND1 V1 DUALS 

who 

REMAIN IN ESSENTIALLY 

SOUND 

OVERALL ADJUSTMENT 

WHILE 

UNDERTAKING STRESSFUL 

DUT1ES 

in Canada ! s Northland. 


It WAS ASSUMED THAT ALL PERSONNEL WERE NORMALLY 
ADJUSTED TO ARMY LIFE BEFORE THE EXERCISE AND THERE¬ 
FORE MALADJUSTMENT WOULD BE DUE TO NORTHERN SERVICE 

conditions. Results of the project, however, suggest 

SOME MODIFICATION TO THIS ASSUMPTION. 

General Approach: 


Very little work has been done with regard

TO FACTORS IN THE PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT OF GOOD TROOPS. 

When the inquiry pushes further and seeks information 

CONCERNING ADJUSTMENT UNDER SEVERE COLD-WEATHER CON¬ 
DITIONS, STILL LESS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. A 
REVIEW OF PREVIOUS STUDIES IN ALLIED FIELDS REVEALS 
LARGELY A NEGATIVE APPROACH. 

Blair (2) dealt with disciplinary offenders 
in the Canadian Army and used subjects who were inmates 
of Military Detention Barracks. He employed two control 

GROUPS OF NON-OFFENDERS, ONE MATCHED AND ONE RANDOMLY 
SELECTED. HE ADMINISTERED THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC 

Personality Inventory to all groups and studied the 

MEAN DIFFERENCES. HlS SAMPLES INCLUDED BOTH PARTIALLY 
TRAINED AND TRAINED SOLDIERS, AND HIS CONTROLS WERE 
COMPOSED OF MEN WITH CLEAR CRIME SHEETS FOR THE TWELVE 
MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EXPERIMENT. THUS 
HIS COMPARISON WAS ON THE BASIS OF DELINQUENCY ALONE 
AND NO ONE OF HIS GROUPS REPRESENTED AN ENTIRELY 
TYPICAL SOLDIER . 

HE CONCLUDED THAT ALL GROUPS DIFFERED SIG¬ 
NIFICANTLY ON MOST PHASES FROM THE TEST AUTHORS* NORMS 
AND THAT THERE WAS A RELATIVELY HIGHER STATISTICALLY 
RELIABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFENDERS AND N0N-0FFENDERS 
ON THE "Pd", "SC", AND "MA" SCALES.

SCHMIDT (3) DESCRIBES THE USE OF THE MINNE¬ 
SOTA Multiphasic Personality Inventory in a clinical 
situation. He used enlisted white males of the Army 
Air Forces. The men were studied in two groups: 

98 NORMAL INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE BEING RECLASSIFIED FOR 
ADMINISTRATIVE REASONS, AND 121 SUBJECTS WHOSE MALADJ¬ 
USTMENT LED TO A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF PSYCHIATRIC DIS¬ 
ABILITY. 

HE DISCOVERED THAT THE TEST DISTINGUISHED 
SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN NORMAL AND ABNORMAL INDIVIDUALS 
AND BETWEEN MAJOR CLINICAL GROUPS. HE CONCLUDED THAT 
IT PROVIDED A USEFUL INDICATION OF TRENDS WARDS PER¬ 
SONALITY ABNORMALITIES. 

Clark ( 4 ) studied a group of soldiers con- 

viced OF THE OFFENSE OF AWOL FROM A UNIT WARNED FOR 
despatch overseas. He DISCOVERED THAT THESE men 
OBTAINED MEAN SCORES ON THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC 

Personality Inventory which were significantly higher 

THAN THOSE of THE TEST AUTHORS, AND OF THE "NORMAL * 1 
GROUP TESTED BY SCHMIDT (3)* THE GROUP PROFILE WAS 
SIMILAR TO THAT OF A SMALL GROUP OF PSYCHONEUROTICS 
STUD I ED BY GOUGH (5)• 

It is apparent that the work which has been

DONE CONCENTRATES ON SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BECOME DELIN¬ 
QUENTS OR PSYCHIATRIC REFERRALS. NONE OF THESE STUDIES 
CONSIDERS ENVIRONMENT AS A SPECIFIC FACTOR IN THE 
INDIVIDUAL’S CURRENT ADJUSTMENT. IN SEEKING REFERENCES 
TO COLD WEATHER AND RESULTING STRESS IN PERFORMANCE OF 
DUTIES, IT IS FOUND THAT LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN 
DIRECTED TO THE EFFECT OF EXTREME TEMPERATURES ON THE 
HUMAN PERSONALITY. 

The best available infcrmation was provided by 
Smith (6). His reports suggest a positive approach and 

DEAL WITH PEOPLE, NORMAL AND ABNORMAL, WHO REMAIN 
EMPLOYED IN THE NORTH. ALONG THE SAME LINES, AN 
ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE HERE TO DETERMINE AS SOME MEASURE- 
ABLE QUALITY, THE PERSONALITY MAKE-UP OF A SATISFACTORY 
SOLD IER. 

A TEST IS EMPLOYED WHICH MEASURES CERTAIN 
PERSONALITY TRAITS AGAINST A SAMPLE OF "NORMAL* 1 POPU¬ 
LATION. Subjects are studied who, by reason of their 
SUCCESS HERETOFORE IN THE ARMY MUST BE CONSIDERED 

normal Canadian troops in peace-time. An environment 

IS PROVIDED BY MEANS OF A MILITARY EXERCISE, OR MOCK 
BATTLE, WHICH IS UNUSUAL BY REASON OF BEING IN CANADA’S 

barren Northland during severe winter weather. A rating

A CRITERION BY WHICH FUNCTIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL CAN BE ESTABLISHED. A COMPARISON OF TEST 
RESULTS WITH RATING-SHEET RESULTS IS THEN UNDERTAKEN 
TO DISCOVER THE PERSONALITY TRAITS WHICH APPEAR SIG¬ 
NIFICANT FOR SUCCESSFUL ADJUSTMENT TO NORTHERN SERVICE. 
PEFINITIqns : 

It is necessary first to show exactly what 
IS MEANT BY "THE CANADIAN SOLDIER”. He VARIES CON¬ 
SIDERABLY DEPENDING ON WHETHER THERE IS WAR OR PEACE 
IN THE LAND. IT IS ACCEPTED THAT DURING TIME OF WAR 
LARGE NUMBERS OF MEN ARE MOTIVATED TOWARDS SOLDIERING 
AND ARE EMPLOYED VERY ADVANTAGEOUSLY IN THE ARMY, WHO 
HAVE NEITHER THE DESIRE NOR THE DYNAMIC ABILITY TO 
PERFORM WELL AS CAREER SOLDIERS IN PEACE-TIME. THIS 
IS THE SAME SORT OF ACTIVITY AS THAT UNDERTAKEN BY 
VOLUNTEER DIKE-WORKERS IN FLOOD EMERGENCIES, OR FIRST 
AID ASSISTANTS IN TIME OF DISASTER. THE FACT THAT 
SUCH INDIVIDUALS CAN BE TRAINED INTO FIRST CLASS 
FIGHTING TEAMS IS A TRIBUTE TO THE VERSATILITY OF THE 

Canadian citizen. It is hoped now, that by studying 

THOSE MEN WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN THE ARMY EVEN IN 
PEACE-TIME, SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE OF THE DRIVES AND 
MOTIVES OF A SOLDIER WILL BE ACQUIRED.

"The Canadian Soldier" therefore will refer to the 

TRAINED INDIVIDUAL WHO FUNCTIONS IN THE CANADIAN 

Army Active Force Brigade Group and who is thus auto¬ 
matically IN AN OPERATIONAL ROLE. GENERALLY SPEAKING, 
HE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO ALL SELECTION DEVICES NOW 
EXISTENT IN THE ARMY TO PROCURE MEN OF THE MOST SATIS¬ 
FACTORY TYPE FOR SUCH SERVICES. HE HAS BEEN REQUIRED 
TO MEET VERY HIGH STANDARDS. 

"Exercise Sweetbriar", was a joint operation 
involving Canadian and United States Armies and Air 
Forces. It was the first large-scale action of com¬ 
batant forces in the North in peace-time. The Canadian 
Active Force Brigade troops were employed, and were 
given special training before participation. It pro¬ 
vided THE CLOSEST APPROXIMATION TO BATTLE CONDITIONS 
THAT CAN BE SIMULATED NOW. ONLY SOLDIERS DETAILED TO 
PROCEED ON THE EXERCISE WERE TESTED AND USED IN THIS 
STUDY. 

"The North", has general geographic reference 
to Northern Canada, but is intended primarily to 

DESCRIBE ISOLATED AREAS WHERE CONTACT WITH CIVILIZATION 

is difficult. The specific training and the Exercise

’’Personal i ty”, is broadly assumed to mean 

A COMPOSITE OF MOTIVATION, CAPACITY, AND CONTROL IN 
THE INDIVIDUAL WHICH PERMITS ADJUSTMENT TO HIS ENVIRON¬ 
MENT. IN THIS STUDY, SERVICE LIFE IN THE CANADIAN ARMY 
UNDER OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE NORTH PROVIDED A 
SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT. THE ’’COMPOSITE” OR PERSONALITY, 
WHICH BEST SUITS THIS ENVIRONMENT IS WHAT MUST BE 
DETERM I NED. 

’’The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory”, (7)* (8), (9)> (TO), (11), by Starke R. 
Hathaway and J. Charnley McKinley, has been selected 
as the instrument by which such determination might 
be achieved. It will be referred to throughout as 
’’The Test” or ’’The M M P I”. A description of the 
test is included together with comprehensive reasons 

FOR ITS SELECTION. 








ARMY SELECTION PROBLEMS 


1 NT RO DUCT ION : 

The ultimate object of all screening and selec¬ 
tion PROCEDURES MUST BE FUNCTIONAL. DOES THE INDIVIDUAL 
PERFORM SATISFACTORILY AFTER THE ACCEPTANCE AND PLACE¬ 
MENT? This is an ever-present criterion for success. 

Many selection devices already are in use in 
the Army. The individual has been screened carefully 

TO ENSURE THAT HE POSSESSES THE ABILITY TO FUNCTION AS 

a soldier. There has been little attempt, however, to 

LOOK FOR QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED FOR SATISFACTORY 
ACHIEVEMENT IN THE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENT OF THE NORTH. 

Before studying this aspect, it is necessary to review 

PRESENT SELECTION METHODS TO DISCOVER WHAT NORMAL PRO¬ 
CESSING HAS ALREADY BEEN UNDERTAKEN WITH THE SUBJECTS 
IN THIS WORK. 

HI STORI CAL : 

The oldest method for selection of fighting 

PERSONNEL PROBABLY HAD A FUNCTIONAL BASIS, DETERMINED 
BY TRIAL AND ERROR. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CO U L D N 1 T FIGHT 
AVOIDED TROUBLE AND THUS "SELECTION*’ OF WARRIORS WAS 
DIRECT AND PERSONAL. IN FEUDAL TIMES, THE LORD OF THE 

Manor, or his overseer, knew the performance of individual 









































. 


















' 




















. 












RETAINERS, AND PH Y S I C A L L Y-L I M I T E D PERSONNEL WERE GIVEN 


JOBS AS GROOMS OR ATTENDANTS WITHIN THEIR CAPABILITIE$• 

Later, wars were fought primarily by mercenaries who 

SOLD SKILL-AT-ARMS AS A COMMODITY, THE PRICE VARYING 
WITH THE PROOF OF ABILITY. 

IT WAS NOT UNTIL COMPARATIVELY MODERN TIMES 
THAT A MORE MATERIAL BASIS FOR THE HIRING OF SOLDIERS 
BECAME IMPORTANT. AS CITIZEN ARMIES APPEARED, WHERE 
INDIVIDUALS FOUGHT FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN TIME OF WAR, 

BUT WERE ESSENTIALLY CIVILIANS MEETING A NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY, THE NEED FOR SYSTEMATIC SELECTION BECAME 

apparent. Enthusiastic patriots who had bad hearts, 

OR LUNGS, OR LEGS, WERE LIABILITIES IN A COMBATANT ROLE. 

Hence physical standards were established and a medical 

SCREENING OR RECRUITS TOOK PLACE. AFTER THE 191^-l8 
WAR THIS NEED WAS EMPHASIZED IN A DIFFEFENT WAY BY A 
HUGE CLAIM FOR INDIVIDUAL PENSIONS AS PAYMENT FOR 
DETERIORATED PHYSICAL CONDITION RESULTING FROM WAR 
SERVICE. 

IN 1939* AS THE CANADIAN ARMY MOBILIZED, 
RECRUITS WERE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED LARGELY ON A PHYSICAL 
BASIS* AS THE INITIAL ADMINISTRATIVE PRESSURE LESSENED 
AND MEDICAL OFFICERS BECAME MORE EXPERIENCED, THE VAGUE 
RIGIDITY OF AN "A”, n B", "C” CATiGORY SYSTEM DISPLAYED 






- 12 - 


MANY WEAKNESSES. WlTH EMPHASIS ON ECONOMY OF MANPOWER, 
FUNCTION BECAME MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANATOMICAL PER¬ 
FECTION. 

The Personnel Selection Service was estab¬ 
lished IN 19^1 TO ASSIST IN THE CORRECT PLACEMENT OF 
PERSONNEL ACCORDING TO INDIVIDUAL FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES, 
AND THE NEEDS OF THE SERVICE. REVISION OF PHYSICAL 
STANDARDS BECAME AN IMMEDIATE NECESSITY AND THE "PULHEMS" 
(12) SYSTEM OF MEDICAL GRADING RESULTED. THIS INVOLVED 
A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL ABILITY OF 
THE INDIVIDUAL FOR ARMY PURPOSES, INCLUDING INTELLEC¬ 
TUAL POTENTIAL AND EMOTIONAL STABILITY. A QUICK JOB 
ANALYSIS ESTABLISHED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARMY 
EMPLOYMENT AND THE MEDICAL DESCRIPTION OR "PROFILE”. 

The Personnel Officer, or Army Examiner as he was then 

CALLED, UTILIZED ALL THIS INFORMATION TOGETHER WITH 
HIS ASSESSMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL FROM PERSONAL INTER¬ 
VIEW, TO ALLOCATE THE RECRUIT TO THE POST IN THE 
ARMY WHERE HE COULD PERFORM AT HIS MAXIMUM. 

PSYCHIATRISTS WERE EMPLOYED AS CONSULTANTS 

to Medical Boards and eventually on the Boards to 

ESTABLISH THE STABILITY AND MENTAL GRADING. HOWEVER,

Depots PRECLUDED CLINICAL EVALUATION OF APPLICANTS. 

Various questionnaires were employed, and close 

LIASION BETWEEN PERSONNEL OFFICERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS 
HELPED TO DETECT INDIVIDUALS OBVIOUSLY ABNORMAL WITH 
REGARD TO PERSONALITY. No ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO STUDY 
THE PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT OF SOLDIERS AFTER ENLISTMENT. 
PSYCHIATRIC REFERRALS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY ON A 
MEDICAL BASIS AFTER MALADJUSTMENT HAD BECOME OBVIOUS. 

Post-War Selection : 

Since the war, in the Active Force, enlist¬ 
ment PROCEDURE REMAINS SIMILAR EXCEPT THAT THERE IS 
NOT A PSYCHIATRIST ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. PERSONNEL 

Depots, through which a man enters the Army, employ 

TEAMS OF MEDICAL AND PERSONNEL OFFICERS. THE PHYSICAL 
REQUIREMENTS ARE HIGH AND THE RECRUIT IS CAREFULLY 
EXAMINED TO ENSURE THAT HE MEETS THEM. 

AN INTELLIGENCE TEST, COMBINED WITH A 
PERSONAL INTERVIEW BY THE SPECIALIST PERSONNEL OFFICER, 
DISCOVERS HIS MENTAL ABILITY, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND 
AND GENERAL SUITABILITY FOR ENLISTMENT. HE IS THEN 
ALLOCATED TO A CORPS IN THE ARMY ACCORDING TO HIS 
POTENTIALITIES AND THE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. AFTER 






















s : •:'!•!: TAH* v :

ACCEPTANCE, THE SOLDIER IS SENT TO A SCHOOL FOR GENERAL 


MILITARY TRAINING, AND SPEC I AL-TO-CORPS TRAINING. IT 
IS ONLY AFTER A MINIMUM OF SIX MONTHS AT THE SCHOOL, 
THAT THE PARTIALLY TRAINED SOLDIER IS POSTED TO A UNIT 
IN THE BRIGADE GROUP TO COMPLETE TRAINING AND LEARN 
OPERATIONAL METHODS OF WARFARE. MANY APPLICANTS ARE 
REJECTED ALONG THIS ROUTE AND IT MUST BE ACCEPTED THAT 
MEMBERSHIP IN THE BRIGADE CONSTITUTES THE FIRST AND 
BEST CRITERION FOR SUCCESS AS A SOLDIER. DESPITE 
INDIVIDUAL MISPLACEMENTS WHICH MAY BE APPARENT,. 

Brigade Group personnel are, theoretically at least, 
Canadian soldiers at their best. 

It is obvious, however, that during this 
selection process, the only approach to personality 
study appears in the interview by a Personnel Officer. 
This is in no sense a clinical study, and his appraisal 
depends largely upon results of the intelligence test, 

AND THE INDIVIDUAL^ OWN STORY OF INTERESTS AND 

occupational record. It is at this point in the 

ROUTINE THAT ADDITIONAL TESTING MATERIAL MIGHT BE 
INTRODUCED WITH PREDICTIVE VALUE AS TO ADJUSTMENT TO 
SERVICE CONDITIONS. 

The PRICE PAID BY THE SERVICE FOR NEGLECT OF 
THIS ASPECT IS EXTREMELY HIGH. DURING THE 1939~^5 WAR >

DESPITE ROUGHNESS OF PSYCHIATRIC SCREENING PROCEDURES, 
ALMOST FORTY-FIVE PERCENT OF REJECTIONS AT DEPOTS WERE 
PSYCHIATRIC, NERVOUS AND MENTAL DEFECTS. IN ADDITION 

to this, ’’Forty percent of discharges of soldiers - 

IN- TRAINING ON MEDICAL GROUNDS ARE DUE TO NEURO¬ 
PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS AND THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT OF 
BATTLE CASUALTIES ARE DUE TO THE SAME GROUNDS . ”(13) 

Any PROCEDURE WILL BE WELCOME THEN, WHICH APPRECIABLY 
LOWERS THE RISK OF ’’HIRING” INDIVIDUALS WITH SUFFICIENT 
TENDENCY TOWARDS THE ABNORMAL TO BREAK DOWN UNDER 
SERVICE CONDITIONS. |F NORTHERN SERVICE REQUIRES 
SPECIAL QUALITIES IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO SECURE 
SOME MEANS OF IDENTIFYING, EARLY IN HIS CAREER, THE 
INDIVIDUAL MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN SUCH AN ENVIRON¬ 


MENT 










THE PRESENT STUDY 


Objec t: 

This study set out to discover what effect 

WINTER WARFARE CONDUCTED IN CANADA'S NORTHLAND WOULD 
HAVE ON THE PERSONAL ADJUSTMENT OF SOLDIERS. SOME 
MODIFICATION OF EMPHASIS ON THE WORD "WINTER* 1 IS NOW 
NECESSARY. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A TWO MONTH TRAINING 

period and Exercise, within the paternal structure 

OF A MODERN ARMY IS INSUFFICIENT EXPOSURE DEFINITELY 
TO ATTRIBUTE SUCCESSES OR SHORTCOMINGS TO WINTER 
CONDITIONS AMD ISOLATION. 

However, adjustment of individuals varied 

CONSIDERABLY, AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT VALUABLE INFOR¬ 
MATION HAS BEEN ACQUIRED CONCERNING POTENTIALLY "GOOD ft 
SOLDIERS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE SPECIFIC EFFECT 

of "the North" is overshadowed by that of a general 

MILITARY ENVIRONMENT. THE POSSIBILITY ARISES THAT 
PSYCHOMETRIC DISTINCTION CAN BE MADE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS 
WHOSE PERSONALITY TRAITS WILL NOT TOLERATE THE EXTRA 
AND SPECIAL DEMANDS OF SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT, AND THOSE 
WHO WILL REMAIN IN ESSENTIALLY SOUND ADJUSTMENT. THE 
ORIGINAL OBJECT IS EXTENDED THEREFORE TO A REVIEW OF 
THIS POSSIBILITY IN TERMS OF A GENERAL SELECTION DEVICE.

ment WERE TO CONCENTRATE AT WAINWRIGHT MILITARY CAMP 
in Alberta during December, 19^9* They would spend 

SIX WEEKS IN THIS AREA, TRAINING AND UNDERGOING 

’’Winter I ndoctr i nat i on”. They were based in hutted 

ACCOMMODATION, BUT WERE CALLED UPON CONTINUALLY TO 
WORK IN SUB-ZERO WEATHER, AND FREQUENTLY TO LIVE OUT¬ 
SIDE. 

Testing must perforce be undertaken during 

THIS CONCENTRATION AND TRAINING PERIOD. THE GENERAL- 

Off i c er-Command ins Western Army Command, approved the 

TESTING PROGRAM, BUT WOULD NOT PERMIT INTERFERENCE 
WITH TRAINING SYLLABI. IT BECAME ESSENTIAL, THEREFORE, 
TO EMPLOY A TEST WHICH PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
INDIVIDUAL'S PERSONALITY, YET COULD BE ADMINISTERED 
IN A GROUP FORM. THE MINNESOTA MULTiPHASIC PERSONALITY 

Inventory was selected as best meeting such require¬ 
ments. 

The next important consideration was to 
establish the criterion by which the effect of the 
exercise on each soldier could be measured. Some 

THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO SETTING UP AN OBSERVER TEAM TO

ACCOMPANY THE TROOPS INTO ACTION, IT WAS DECIDED, HOW¬ 
EVER, THAT MODERN INFANTRY TACTICS WOULD NOT PERMIT 
CLOSE OBSERVATION ON LARGE NUMBERS OF SUBJECTS. At 
THE SAME TIME, IT WAS BROUGHT TO ATTENTION THAT THE 
CRITERION WOULD HAVE TO BE SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE 
AS A SOLDIER DURING OPERATIONS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER 
OR NOT THERE WERE MINOR PERSONALITY DISTURBANCES IN 
THE INDIVIDUAL. 

The solution appeared to lie in a rating 

OF EACH MAN BY HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERVISING OFFICER. 

Such a plan was adopted and a rating sheet was 

DEV I SED. 

Evaluation of results involved establishment 

OF A MEAN PROFILE ON THE TEST FOR ALL SOLDIERS RATED 
BETTER THAN w GOOD M AND COMPARISON WITH A MEAN PROFILE 
FOR THOSE LOWER THAN "GOOD 11 . 

A REVIEW OF RECENT WORK USING THE NMPI WITH 
SERVICE PERSONNEL SUGGESTED THAT SPECIAL ATTENTION MUST 
BE GIVEN TO TEST NORMS BEFORE THE RESULTS COULD BE 
EVALUATED. BOTH BLAIR, (2) AND SCHMIDT, (3) DISCOVERED 
THAT THE AUTHORS 1 NORM FOR AMERICAN CIVILIANS WAS 
DIFFERENT FROM THAT ESTABLISHED FOR SOLDIERS. THE 
THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY AROSE THAT NOT ONLY WERE A GROUP

OF SOLDIERS DIFFERENT FROM AVERAGE CIVILIANS, BUT 
PERHAPS ALSO CANADIANS WERE DIFFERENT FROM AMERICANS. 

The Exercise provided a particularly good 

OPPORTUNITY TO ESTABLISH A MEAN PROFILE FOR THE CAN¬ 
ADIAN SOLDIER AS A SEPARATE ENTITY. NOT ONLY WAS A 
NUMERICALLY LARGE SAMPLE AVAILABLE, BUT THE BALANCED 
GROUP INVOLVING COMBATANT TROOPS, TRADESMEN AND 
SERVICE CORPS, INCLUDED ALL THE VARIOUS TYPES OF MEN 
WHO CAN NOW FIND A FULL-TIME CAREER IN AN ARMY SETTING. 

IN ADDITION, THE CONCENTRATION INVOLVED BRINGING MEN 
FROM ALL PARTS OF CANADA. 

The Infantry component contained a prepond- 

ERENCE OF WESTERNERS, BUT ALSO HAD REASONABLE NUMBERS 
FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY THE MAR I - 

times. Other wits were representative of their corps, 

WHICH ARE RECRUITED IN ALL PARTS OF THE DOMINION. HENCE 
THERE IS AN ADEQUATE INCLUSION OF EASTERN AND CENTRAL 

Canadians to consider the group representative of English 
speaking Canada. 

Having established a mean profile on the test 
for the Canadian soldier, this could become the norm 
from which significant deviation might be measured. 

Some temerity was felt in setting this standard, as the

M Poo r “a nd “Fair” soldiers were thus included in the 

MEASURING DEVICE. NEVERTHELESS, ALL MEN WERE RATED 
AS OPERATIONAL TROOPS BEFORE ENTERING UPON THE EXER¬ 
CISE, AND IT WAS CONSIDERED FRD P E R TO USE ALL GROUPS. 
IT WAS HOPED THAT, IN GENERAL, RATINGS EITHER HIGH OR 
LOW WOULD EXPRESS THE EFFECT OF THE SPECIFIC RIGOROUS 
ENVIRONMENT ON THE INDIVIDUAL, AND THUS DISCLOSE A 
PERSONALITY TENDENCY WHICH MIGHT BE ACCEPTABLE UNDER 
LESS STRESSFUL SERVICE CONDITIONS, BUT WHICH LESSENED 
EFFICIENCY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE NORTH. 

In evaluating results it was found that 

DIFFERENCES DISCOVERED BY THE RATING CRITERION COULD 
BE STUDIED TO BETTER ADVANTAGE BY COMPARING MEAN TEST 
SCORES OF HIGH AND LOW GROUPS WITH EACH OTHER, RATHER 
THAN WITH THE MEAN PROFILE FROM THE CANADIAN SOLDIER. 

Materials and Scope : 

The subjects consisted of 620 trained 
soldiers of Canada*s Active Force Brigade Group. 

They were tested during a concentration period at 
Wainwright, Alberta. All ranks up to and including 
that of Captain were used. All men had been re¬ 
examined MEDICALLY AND WERE PRONOUNCED PHYSICALLY

SUITABLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE NORTHERN EXERCISE. 

TO ENSURE THAT RESULTS PICTURED A MODERN 
SOLDIER, SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM ALL CORPS* THE 
ACTUAL NUMBERS USED AND BREAKDOWN BETWEEN CORPS IS 

shown i n Table 1. 

Testing conditions were not ideal, as no 

INTERFERENCE WITH TRAINING WAS PERMITTED. THE GROUP 
FORM OF THE TEST WAS USED AND IT WAS USUALLY ADMIN¬ 
ISTERED AFTER DUTY HOURS IN THE ME N 1 S SLEEPING QUARTERS, 
WITH THE INDIVIDUALS SPRAWLED OUT ON BEDS. HOWEVER, 

THE PROJECT WAS WELL RECEIVED AND THERE IS NO REASON 
TO BELIEVE THAT PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT DURING TEST PER¬ 
FORMANCE CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN RESULTS. 

Close supervision was possible and helped reduce the 

NUMBER OF INCOMPLETE OR INVALID RETURNS. 

The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven¬ 
tory HAS BEEN DESCRIBED ADEQUATELY ELSEWHERE AS TO ITS 
CONSTRUCTION AND STANDARDIZATION (7)j (8), (9)> (lO), ( 1 1 )* 

St IS NECESSARY HERE, HOWEVER, TO POINT OUT ITS PARTIC¬ 
ULAR VALUES IN THE PRESENT STUDY. 

The first consideration was that some work has 

ALREADY BEEN DONE BOTH ON NORTHERN RESIDENTS (6) AND ON 

Service personnel, (2), (3)* using the MMPI .

Secondly, the test is available in group form 

AND IS THEREFORE PARTICULARLY ADAPTABLE TO THE CONDITIONS 
UNDER WHICH THIS PROJECT MUST BE CARRIED OUT. 

Thirdly, "The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality 
Inventory is a psychometric instrument designed pri¬ 
marily to provide in a single test, scores on all the 
more important phases of personality" (14)• The group 

FORM, WHICH WAS USED IN THIS WORK, CONSISTS OF 566 STATE¬ 
MENTS, PRINTED IN A BOOKLET, TO WHICH "TRUE" OR "FALSE" 
RESPONSES ARE INDICATE). SUBJECT MATTER VARIES FROM 
PHYSICAL CONDITION TO THE MORALE, AND SOCIAL ATTITUDES 
OF THE INDIVIDUAL. MINE PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS 
ARE SCORED FROM THE ANSWERS:- HYPOCHONDRIASIS, DEPR¬ 
ESSION, HYSTERIA, PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY, MASCULINITY- 
FEMININITY, PARANOIA, PSYCHASTHENI A, SCHIZOPHRENIA AND 
HYPOMANIA. Each OF THESE PHASES HAS BEEN VALIDATED 
AGAINST CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED ABNORMAL CASES. THE VALUE 
OF THE TEST FOR THIS STUDY LIES IN THE FACT THAT SCORES 
ARE DERIVED ALONG A CONTINUM FROM NORMAL TO ABNORMAL SO 
THAT BORDERLINE CASES AND TRENDS ARE INDICATED. 

In view of THE GENERAL nature OF PSYCHIATRIC 
NOSOLOGY, THE BROAD SYNDROME CONSIDERED BY THE TEST 
AUTHORS AS CLINICALLY TYPICAL OF EACH PHASE, IS GIVEN

HERE IN BRIEF R E SUME : - 

Th e Hypochondriasis Scale (Hs ) - is a measure of the 

AMOUNT OF ABNORMAL CONCERN ABOUT BODILY FUNCTIONS. 

Subject is immature in approach to adult problems and 

TENDS TO RESPOND WITH INADEQUATE INSIGHT. 

The Depression Scale (D) - measures poor morale of the 

EMOTIONAL TYPE. SUBJECT LACKS SELF-CONFIDENCE, HAS A 
TENDENCY TO WORRY, AND SHOWS NARROWNESS OF INTERESTS 
AND INTROVERSION. 

The Hysteria Scale , (Hy) - measures the similarity to 

CONVERSION-TYPE HYSTERIA. COMPLAINTS MAY BE SYSTEMIC 

or specific. Under stress the high scoring subject 

MAY BECOME OVERTLY HYSTERICAL AND SOLVE PROBLEMS BY 
DEVELOPING SYMPTOMS. 

The Psychopathic Deviate Scale , (Pd) - measures absence 
of deep emotional response, inability to profit from 

EXPERIENCE, AND A DISREGARD OF SOCIAL MORES. MOST 
FREQUENT DIGRESSIONS FROM THE SOCIAL MORES ARE LYING, 
STEALING. THE EQUIVALENT TERMS FOR PSYCHOPATHIC 
DEVIATE IN STANDARD WORKS ARE PSYCHOPATH 1 C PERSON- 
ALITY n , “PSYCHOPATHIC INFERIOR 11 , OR “PSYCHOPATHIC 

state”. 


The Masculinity-Femininity Scale, (Mf) - measures the 















•24- 


deviation OF THE BASIC INTEREST PATTERN IN THE DIRECTION 
OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. 

The Paranoia Scale ,(Pa) - measures the tendency towards 
SUSPICIOUSNESS, over-sensitivity and delusions of perse- 
cut ION. 

The Psychasthenia Scale ,(Pt) - measures the tendency 

TOWARDS PHOBIAS OR COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR. IT MAY BE 
MANIFESTED MERELY IN A DEPRESSION, EXCESSIVE WORRY, 

LACK OF CONFIDENCE OR INABILITY TO CONCENTRATE. 

The Schizophr e nia Scale , (Sc) - measures the tendency 

TOWARDS BIZARRE AND UNUSUAL THOUGHTS OR BEHAVIOR. THERE 
ARE IRRATIONAL SHIFTS IN MOOD OR BEHAVIOR. 

The Hypomania Scal e, (Ma) - measures the tendency 

TOWARDS MARKED 0VERPRODUCTI V I TY OF THOUGHT AND ACTION. 

This may result in good or bad behavior. High scores 

MAY INDICATE SUBJECT IS AMBITIOUS, VIGOROUS, AND FULL 
OF PLANS. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE MAY BE SOMEWHAT 
DEPRESSED AT TIMES, AND HIS ACTIVITIES MAY INTERFERE 
WITH OTHER PEOPLE THOUGH HIS ATTEMPTS TO REFORM SOCIAL 
PRACTICE, HIS ENTHUSIASTIC STIRRING UP OF PROJECTS IN 
WHICH HE THEN MAY LOSE INTEREST, OR HIS DISREGARD OF 


SOCIAL CONVENTIONS

The Validating Scores (?, L, F and K) 

The first problem in evaluating test results 

IS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THE SCORES ARE VALID FOR THE 
INDIVIDUALS TESTED. FOUR SCALES ARE INCLUDED TO PROVIDE 
A CHECK ON THIS POINT. 

The ? Scale (?) - The raw score on this scale is merely 

THE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS NOT ANSWERED. FOR THE ,, ? ,f SCALE, 
SCORES ABOVE THE T-SCORE OF 60 HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED 
INVALID IN THIS STUDY. 

The Lie Scale ; (L) - is made up of 15 items to detect 

THE PERSON WHO IS LYING IN THE SENSE OF TRYING TO 
PLACE HIMSELF IN A HIGHLY CONVENTIONAL AND SOCIALLY 
ACCEPTABLE LIGHT. A T-SCORE ABOVE JO INDICATES NEED 
FOR CAUTIOUS INTERPRETATION. 

The F Scale : (f) - High scores may legitimately indicate 

HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL AND INDEPENDENT SUBJECTS OR BADLY 
NEUROTIC OR PSYCHOTIC PATIENTS. THE LATTER ARE INEV¬ 
ITABLY BETRAYED BY HIGH SCORES ON OTHER SCALES. EXCEPT 
FOR SUCH CASES, T-SCORES ABOVE JO INVALIDATE THE TEST. 

The K Scale ; (K) - is essentially a correction factor 

WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE OF USE IN SHARPENING THE 
DISCRIMINATORY POWER OF THE CLINICAL VARIABLES. ITS 


EFFECT IS TO ACCENTUATE THE VALIDITY OF FIVE OF THE NINE 


















-26- 


EXISTING CLINICAL SCALES AND TO MAKE NORMALS APPEAR MORE 
NORMAL. 

The conversion of scores to a T scale, and the 

GRAPHICAL METHOD OF PRESENTING RESULTS, FACILITATE GEN¬ 
ERALIZATION ON THE BASIS OF STANDARDIZED PROFILES. FOR 
PREDICTION PURPOSES IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT A FIXED NORM 
BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL'S PROFILE 
CAN BE MEASURED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE FIRST STEP 
WAS TO DISCOVER THE MEAN PROFILE FOR THE CANADIAN SOLDIER. 

Results were then sharpened by comparing extreme groups 

DIRECTLY WITH EACH OTHER. 

The rating sheet was made as simple as possible 

AND WAS ACCOMPANIED BY WRITTEN DIRECTIONS FOR ITS USE. 

In ADDITION MOST OF THE OFFICERS USING IT WERE GIVEN A 
BRIEF LECTURE AS TO THE GENERAL PLAN OF THE PROJECT AND 
THE NEED FOR OBJECTIVITY IN RATING. IT WAS HOPED THUS 
TO MINIMIZE BIAS AND AMBIGUITY, AND ACHIEVE A REASONABLE 
UNIFORMITY IN THE GRADINGS. 

On the rating sheet, the individual's FUNC¬ 
TIONAL PERFORMANCE WAS SHOWN AS DEPENDING ON TEN PERSONAL 
QUALITIES. Each OF these WAS to BE rated on a FIVE-POINT 
SCALE FROM OUTSTANDING, THROUGH SUPERIOR, GOOD, PAIR, TO 

Poor. The form and instructions for its use are shown

IN THIS PARTICULAR COLUMN HAVE BEEN USED FOR SEGREG¬ 
ATION OF GROUPS AND COMPARISONS THROUGHOUT THIS WORK. 

The system remains subject to the various 

WEAKNESSES OF ANY RATING CLASSIFICATION. HOWEVER, THE 
OFFICERS USING IT WERE LARGELY UNIVERSITY MEN, AND ALL 
WERE FULLY EMPLOYED IN A CAREER INVOLVING CONTINUAL 
DIRECTION AND UNDERSTANDING OF SOLDIERS. IT IS ASSUMED, 
THEREFORE, THAT THE CRITERION OF PERFORMANCE WAS ARRIVED

Blair, (2) in his study of Army delinquents 

ENCOUNTERED THE FACT THAT THE NORMS OF HIS CONTROL GROUPS 
OF SOLDIERS DIFFERED FROM THAT OF THE TEST AUTHORS. THIS 
WAS MORE SURPRISING IN THAT HE HAD USED A "MODEL** SELECTION 
FOR HIS GROUPS, INCLUDING ONLY THOSE WITH NO ARMY CRIME

record, It seemeo logical therefore, in approaching 

THE PRESENT STUOY, TO ESTABLISH FIRST A SEPARATE NORM 
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A MEAN OF THE TRAI NED SOLDIER. 

The WORD TRAINED is EMPHASIZED continually because 
CONSIDERABLE TRIAL AND ERROR SELECTION HAS ALREADY BEEN 
APPLIED TO THE GROUP USED, 

Accordingly, a mean was found for the results 
on each scale of the test for the whole group of oOO, 

THE NUMBER FOR WHOM VALID TEST RESULTS AND RATING SHEETS 
COULD BE MATCHED. THE K CORRECTION WAS INCLUDED, AND 
THE FIGURES WERE PLOTTED GRAPHICALLY AGAINST THE AUTHOR’S 
NORM. THE RESULT IS SHOWN IN FIGURE 1. 

It IS APPARENT IMMEDIATELY THAT THERE IS CONSID¬ 
ERABLE DIFFERENCE ON ALL SCALES. IT IS SHOWN LATER THAT 
THE DIFFERENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT AND THAT THIS PRELIMINARY 
TASK WAS INDEED NECESSARY. HOWEVER, THE SCALES SHOWING 
THE LARGEST DEVIATION ARE THE "F* 1 , "Pd", "Sc", AND f, MA ". 

These peaks may well suggest a pattern charagteristic 

OF INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK A CAREER IN THE ARMY. 

A PROJECT UNDERTAKEN FOR THE DEFENCE RESEARCH 

Board at the University of Alberta has provided infor¬ 
mation CONCERNING TYPICAL ALBERTA MALES. PAULSON, THOMAS 
and Smith, (6) established a norm for 3^2 civilians living

NOT NATIONAL IN BREADTH, IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE 
THE DIFFERBCE BETWEEN THE PROFILE OF THIS GROUP AND 
THAT OF THE SOLDIER. SHOWN AT FIGURE 2 IS THE COMPAR¬ 
ISON. 

IT WILL BE NOTED THAT PEAKS OCCUR AGAIN AT 

" f ", "Pd", "Sc” and "Ma". It is also apparent that 

THE SOLDIER, AS MEASURED BY THE MF SCALE, APPEARS CON¬ 
SIDERABLY MORE MASCULINE THAN DOES THE CIVILIAN. THIS, 

IN GENERAL TERMS, MIGHT BE EXPECTED AND IS PROBABLY TRUE. 

Another important observation is that the 

NEUROTIC TRIAD IS LOW FOR 80TH GROUPS, BUT PARTICULARLY 
SO FOR THE SOLDIER. ON THE "D" SCALE THERE IS A 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO WHICH PRODUCES A CRITICAL 
RATIO OF 2.8l, - AND THE SOLDIER IS ON THE LOW SIDE. 

The main point seems to be that the peaks on 

THE SOLDIER PROFILE ARE PECULIAR TO SOLDIERS AS OPPOSED 
TO CIVILIANS, RATHER THAN TO CANADIANS AS OPPOSED TO 

Americans. The profile in Figure 1, then, will be 

REFERRED TO THROUGHOUT AS "TH E CANADIAN SOLDI E R " PROF I LE 
AND ABBREVIATED No.

THIS GROUP OF SOLDIERS AND THE GROUP USED BY THE AUTHORS 
IN STANDARDIZING THE TEST, A CRITICAL RATIO FORMULA WAS 
APPLIED TO THE RESULTS OBTAINED FOR EACH SUBJECT GROUP. 

The figures presented as ’’authors Norms” were corrected 

TO REPRESENT NORMAL MALES, AND WERE KINDLY PROVIDED BY 

Dr. Starke R. Hathaway in personal correspondence with 
Dr. D. E. Smith of the University of Alberta. 

The formula used is: - 


CR 


M, “ M* 

2 £ 
CTj / CTi. 

N | r N % 


AND IS DERIVED AND DESCRIBED IN DETAIL BY LINDQUIST (15). 

A CRITICAL RATIO OF 3*0 0R HIGHER INDICATES THERE WOULD 
BE AT LEAST 99 • 9 CHANCES IN 100 THAT THERE IS AN ACTUAL 
DIFFERENCE. 

The TABULATED COMPARISON IS SHOWN IN TABLE 2. 

It IS AGAIN OBVIOUS THAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE 
LARGE AND REAL. THE SDS ARE UNIFORM, WITH THE POSSIBLE 
EXCEPTION OF SC, WHICH GOES UP TO 7*3^ AND USUALLY HIGHER 
THAN THOSE OF THE AUTHORS. THE CRS ARE ALL HIGH, SHOWING 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES, BUT PARTICULARLY SO FOR, ”Pd”,

"Mf ", "SC”, AND "Ma". 

In TABLE 3? ,s SHOWN A similar comparison 
BETWEEN THE CANADIAN So LD1ER AND THE ALBERTA MALE CIVILIAN. 

Again it can be seen that the Soldier is significantly 
HIGHER ON, "F”, "Pd", "SC " AND "Ma". HOWEVER, AS BECAME 

APPARENT IN THE PROFILE COMPARISON, THE CIVILIAN IS SIG¬ 
NIFICANTLY HIGHER ON, "Mf" AND "D". 

Having determined that the soldier as such, is 

A SPECIAL KIND OF INDIVIDUAL, IT IS INTENDED NOW TO WORK 
SOLELY WITH THE SERVICE GROUP. THE DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE 
SAMPLE WHICH ARE DISCOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICIENCY CRI¬ 
TERION, MUST BE CONSIDERED IN RELATION TEST SCORES. 

Rating Sheets 

The performance criterion was to be arrived at 

BY COMPLETION OF RATING SHEETS BY OFFICERS SUPERVISING 
THE SUBJECTS WHILE THE EXERCISE WAS IN PROGRESS. MANY 
OFFICERS HAD TO BE CONTACTED AND DIFFICULTY WAS ANTICI¬ 
PATED IN ASSEMBLING RETURNS. ACTUALLY, DUE TO THE 
SKILLFUL ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANCE OF THE BRIGADE STAFF, 

ALL MEN WERE EVENTUALLY RATED. OF THE ORIGINAL 620 
TESTED, 20 ANSWER SHEETS WERE NOT IDENTIFIABLE FOR VARIOUS 
REASONS, OR WERE INVALIDATED. RATINGS WERE RECEIVED AND 
RELATED TO TEST RESULTS, FOR THE REMAINING 6 00.

TABLE 3

The significant characteristic in the rating 

SHEET WAS CONSIDERED TO BE NUMBER ~[, "OVERALL EFFICIENCY”. 

For this study, social shortcomings, personal problems, 

AND IDIOSYNCRASIES ARE ONLY IMPORTANT AS THEY EFFECT 
PERFORMANCE AS A SOLDIER. HENCE, ACCORDING TO THE RATING 
ASSIGNED IN COLUMN 7 0F THE SHEET, THE V/HOLE GROUP WAS 
DIVIDED INTO SUB-GROUPS WITH NUMBERS AS FOLLOWSI-

Number 

OUTSTAND1NG

Means were found on 

EACH SCALE OF THE TEST FOR 


EACH GROUP. Thus THE VARIOUS MEAN PROFILES could be 
PLOTTED. The MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS ARE SHOWN 

in Table 4 . The profiles are shown in Figures 3 “ 7 - 
The pattern of each group naturally follows 

THAT OF THE No PROFILE. HOWEVER, IT IS APPARENT THAT 
THOSE GRADED, "POOR 11 , ARE HIGHER ON THE PEAKS, AND 
THOSE GRADED "OUTSTANDING”, ARE LOWER ON THE PEAKS THAN 
THE NORM. ON THE Hs, HY, AND MF SCALES THE "Poor" 

GROUP REGISTERS LOWER, BUT BOTH GROUPS ARE WELL WITHIN 
THE NORMALCY LEVEL. A DEFINITE TENDENCY IS APPARENT

THEREFORE, FOR POORER SOLDIERS TO SHOW A MORE IRREGULAR 
PROFILE THAN THEIR MORE EFFICIENT COMRADES. THIS TREND 
WAS ANTICIPATED, BUT IT NOW BECOMES NECESSARY TO STUDY 
IT CAREFULLY TO DECIDE UPON ITS SIGNIFICANCE. 

TO EMPHASIZE THE CONTRAST IN EXTREMES, THE 
"OUTSTAND I NG r * AND "POOR" PROFILES ARE PLOTTED IN 
FIGURE 8. 

However, considering the large number in the 

WHOLE PROJECT, IT DID NOT APPEAR WISE TO WORK WITH THE 
SMALL NUMBERS INCLUDED IN THE EXTREME GROUPS. IT WAS 
FELT THAT AN ADEQUATE DISTINCTION IN PERFORMANCE COULD 
BE MADE BY COMBINING THE "OU T S T A M D I N G n AND "SUPERIOR 11 
SUB-GROUPS AS ONE, AND CONTRASTING THE RESULTING MEAN 
PROFILE WITH THE ONE OBTAINED BY COMBINING THE "FAIR 11 

and "Poor” sub-groups. 

These profiles are shown in Figure 9* 

Although the differences have been softened 
as far as mean test results are concerned, the larger 

NUMBERS INVOLVED MAKE THE SUBJECT GROUPS MORE TYPICAL, 
AND GENERALIZATIONS FROM SUCH A COMPARISON CAN BE 
ATTEMPTED WITH MORE CONFIDENCE. THERE IS STILL AN 
APPARENT DIFFERENCE AT THE PEAK POINTS, AND A STAT¬ 
ISTICAL COMPARISON IS NECESSARY TO DISCOVER THE SIGNIF¬ 


ICANCE OF THESE DIFFERENCES

Means and standard deviations for the 0 / S 

AND THE F / P GROUPS ARE TABULATED IN TABLE 5- 

Pattern : 

In examining the pattern which consistently 

APPEARS IN ALL GROUPS, IT IS NOTED FIRST THAT THE F 
SCALE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN POOR SOLDIERS. THIS 
SCALE IS ESSENTIALLY A VALIDATING DEVICE AND IS NOT 
ITSELF DIAGNOSTIC. IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF QUES¬ 
TIONS USUALLY ANSWERED IN ONE WAY BY NORMAL PEOPLE. 

High scores suggest some deviation from the conven¬ 
tional reply. However, when accompanied by very high 

SCORES ON SOME OF THE OTHER SCALES, A HIGH SCORE ON 
THE F IS PROBABLY A VALID RESULT. IN THIS CASE THE 
TENDENCY TOWARDS HIGH PD AND HIGH Sc WOULD INEVITABLY 
RAISE THE SCORE ON F. IT IS REGARDED, THEN, AS AN 
ADDITIONAL FACTOR IN DEMONSTRATING THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, BUT WITHOUT SPECIAL SIGNIF¬ 
ICANCE IN ITSELF. 

The next interesting point in examining 

THE PATTERN IS THE CONSISTENTLY LOW SCORES ON THE 
THREE SCALES FORMING THE NEUROTIC TRIAD, HS, D, AND 

Hy. Not only is there little difference between 


SCORES FOR EACH OF THE GRADED GROUPS, BUT ALL ARE LOWER

THAN THOSE FOR CANADIAN CIVILIANS AND ARE CLOSE TO THE 


AUTHORS* NORMS. IT WOULD APPEAR FROM THIS THAT THE 
SELECTION DEVICES TO WHICH CANADIAN SOLDIERS ARE 
EXPOSED, SCREEN OUT MEN WITH NEUROTIC TENDENCIES. 

The high scores on Mf are difficult to 

UNDERSTAND IN THE LIGHT OF THE AUTHORS* PRELIMINARY 

work. The norm given in the test manual, ( 13 )> - ”is 

BASED UPON RESPONSES OF 1 1Y MALES. OF THESE 5^ PER 
CENT WERE ENGINEERS OF VARIOUS AGES AND 46 PER CENT 
WERE UNSELECTED ARMY NON-COMMISSIONED MEN.” ST IS 
NOTED THAT IN THE CURRENT PROJECT, THE BETTER SOLDIERS 
ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THE POORER. INSPECTION 
OF SOME OF THE TEST RESULTS SUGGESTS THAT EDUCATION 
AND A REFINED HOME BACKGROUND TEND TO RAISE THE SCORE 
ON THIS SCALE. THIS POSSIBILITY IS CONFIRMED BY 
STUDIES UNDERTAKEN BY PAYNE (l6). 

The Pd and Sc scales suggest the most 

FRUITFUL FIELD FOR INQUIRY AS TO PERSONALITY DEVIA¬ 
TIONS WHICH INFLUENCE ADJUSTMENT UNDER THE STRESS OF 
A TASK SUCH AS THE EXERCISE. THE NO PROFILE INDI¬ 
CATES THAT THE CANADIAN SOLDIER GENERALLY, TENDS TO 
SCORE HIGH ON THESE SCALES. HOWEVER, WITHIN THAT 
PROFILE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEAN

SCORE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN PERFORM THEIR DUTIES 
SATISFACTORILY AND THOSE WHO BECOME INEFFICIENT 
WHEN FACED WITH AN UNUSUAL OR DIFFICULT ENVIRON¬ 
MENT . 

The mean score on Ma is high for all 

GROUPS, AND IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHEN 
GROUPS ARE COMPARED. PERHAPS THE REASON THERE IS 
NOT MORE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE ACTIVITY INDICATED 
BY THIS SCALE MIGHT BE DIRECTED PROPERLY INTO USEFUL 
CHANNELS. SEVERAL OF THE MEN GRADED "OUTSTANDING” 
SHOWED HIGH SCORES ON THIS SCALE. BY INSPECTION 
IT IS NOTED THAT POORER SOLDIERS SCORING HIGH ON 
MA ARE USUALLY HIGH ON Sc OR PD. 

Infantry Corps Compared Wi th”OthersV ; 

In compiling statistics throughout this 
work, the Infantry results were kept separate from 

THE OTHER CORPS. 

This arrangement provided a large group 

OF ESSENTIALLY COMBATANT SOLDIERS AND A SECOND GROUP 
OF MEN, PRIMARILY SOLDIER TRADESMEN. IT IS NOTED^OF 
COURSE, THAT DESPITE THEIR COMBATANT ROLE, THE RCA 
SAMPLE IS INCLUDED IN THE SECOND GROUP.

It is interesting now to observe the mean 

PROFILE COMPARISON OF THESE TWO GROUPS. THE RESULTS 
ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE 10. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED, THE 
TRADESMAN GROUP SHOWS LESS POSITIVE DEVIATION GENER¬ 
ALLY THAN DOES THE FIGHTING SOLDIER. HOWEVER, THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF ANY POSSIBLE DISTINCTION ARE NOT 
DIRECTLY THE OBJECT OF THIS INQUIRY. 

The INCLUSION OF THIS MATERIAL IS INTENDED 
TO DISCOVER WHETHER OR NOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD 

and poor Infantry soldiers is approximately the same 

AS THAT BETWEEN GOOD AND POOR SOLDIERS OF THE SERVICES. 

Hence the same breakdown has been used as for the 

TOTAL GROUP. THE MEAN PROFILE FOR THE INFANTRY 0 / S 
WAS PLOTTED AGAINST THAT FOR THE INFANTRY, F / P, AND 
THE RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE 11. 

Again the mean profile for the Other Corps, 

0 / S, was plotted against that for the Other Corps, 

F / P, AND THE RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN FIGURE 12. 

The STATISTICAL COMPARISON FOR EACH OF THESE 
DIVISIONS IS SHOWN IN TABLES 6 AND J. |T IS NOTED THAT 
THE CR APPROACHES THE SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF 0N THE 

"Pd" AND U SC w SCALES FOR ALL CORPS. THERE IS A RELIABLE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INFANTRY GROUPS ON THE MF SCALE,

— WIT H THE POOR SOLDIER BEING THE LOWER. THE DIFFERENCE 
ON THE F SCALE BETWEEN INFANTRY GROUPS IS AGAIN TAKEN 
TO BE A SUPPORTING FACTOR IN THE HIGH PD AND SC RESULTS, 
RATHER THAN A TREND TOWARDS INVALIDITY. 

The soldier pattern now becomes firm, and 

WHATEVER BREAKDOWN IS USED CERTAIN GENERALIZATIONS APPEAR 
TO BE IN ORDER. TO CONSIDER THESE ON A RELATIVELY 
BROADER PLANE THE RESULTS WILL BE REVIEWED IN A SEPARATE 
CHAPTER.

RESULTS 


Genera l 

It is obvious in studying the detail in 

THE PRECEDING PAGES THAT A PEACE-TIME CAREER IN THE 

Army attracts individuals who display personality 

TENDENCIES DIFFERING CONSISTENTLY, AT LEAST IN 
DEGREE, FROM CIVILIAN MALES. TEST PROFILES SUGGEST 
A PATTERN WHERE THE NEUROTIC TRIAD IS CONSPICUOUSLY 
LOW AND EVEN, AND PEAKS OCCUR ON THE F, PD, SC, AND 

Ma scales. The Mf score is reliably lower than for 
Canadian civilians, but does not descend to the 

AUTHORS 1 NORM. 

Despite the considerable difference at 

THESE PEAKS BETWEEN THE SOLDIER AND CIVILIAN, GOOD 
SOLDIERS, AS RATED BY THEIR OFFICERS, ARE LOWER 
THAN POOR SOLDIERS RATED IN THE SAME MANNER. 

Similar differences are apparent between 

GOOD AND POOR SOLDIERS OF THE INFANTRY CORPS, AND 
BETWEEN GOOD AND POOR SOLDIERS OF A COMPOSITE TRADES¬ 
MAN AND SERVICE CORPS GROUP. IN ALL BREAKDOWNS IT 
IS FOUND THAT THE PD AND SC ARE THE SCALES WHICH 


SHOW THE MOST DIFFERENTIATION AND IT APPEARS LIKELY

THAT THESE TWO PHASES CONSTITUTE THE AREA IN WHICH 
ENQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE IN ANY PREDICTIVE STUDIES. 

The relationships of severe weather and 

ISOLATION TO PERFORMANCE RATINGS IS NOT DEFINITE. 

This environment was certainly an important consid¬ 
eration AS MOST OF THE SUBJECTS HAD PERFORMED SATIS¬ 
FACTORILY ON VERY SIMILAR TRAINING EXERCISES AS FAR 
AS THE ACTUAL MILITARY DUTIES WERE CONCERNED. HOW¬ 
EVER, MUCH MODIFICATION MUST BE MADE IN THE ORIGINAL 
INTENTION OF ATTRIBUTING PERFORMANCE RESULTS SOLELY 
TO NORTHERN CONDITIONS. 

1 NTERPRET AT IONS : 

The first obvious and striking point about 

THE SOLDIER PROFILE IS THE ABSENCE OF NEUROTIC TRENDS, 
- AS MEASURED BY THE TEST. THE SOLDIER IS PICTURED 
ON THE f, TRIAD n SCALES, HS, D, AND HY AS LOWER EVEN 
THAN THE CANADIAN CIVILIAN. FURTHER, THERE IS VERY 
LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN MEAN SCORES BETWEEN GOOD AND 
POOR SOLDIERS. IT IS ENTIRELY LIKELY THEREFORE, THAT 
PRESENT SCREENING DEVICES, INVOLVING A PERSONNEL 

Officer’s interview and medical examination, are 


SUCCESSFUL IN CATCHING AND ELIMINATING MOST POTENTIAL

neurotics. The further processing through General 
Military Training discovers in a lengthy practical 

WAY, THE FEW WHO ELUDE THE DEPOT TEAM. IF THE 
RECRUIT REACHES THE TRAINED SOLDIER STAGE, HE APPAR¬ 
ENTLY HAS VERY LITTLE NEUROTIC MALADJUSTMENT. 

Psychotic tendencies do not appear to 

RECEIVE THE SAME ATTENTION DURING SCREENING AND 
TRAINING PERIODS. AS MEASURED BY THE TEST, THE 
AVERAGE GOOD SOLDIER HAS CONSIDERABLE TREND TOWARDS 
THE ABNORMAL ALONG BOTH PSYCHOPATHIC AND SCHIZO¬ 
PHRENIC LINES AND ALSO SHOWS HYPER-ACTI V I TY ON THE 

Ma scale. Perhaps one or other or all of these 

TRAITS MUST BE PRESENT IN HIGH DEGREE FOR ANY INDIV¬ 
IDUAL IN PEACE-TIME TO WANT TO JOIN A FIGHTING ORGAN¬ 
IZATION. This probability is supported by the fact 

THAT COMBATANT SOLDIERS GENERALLY, SCORE HIGHER THAN 
MEN IN THE SERVICES. 

In ALL BREAKDOWNS, HOWEVER, THERE IS A 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON THESE PEAKS BETWEEN THE 
GROUP GRADED 0 / S AND THAT GRADED F / P. THE POOR 
GROUP SCORE HIGHER AND THEREFORE GREATER ABNORMALITY 
IS SUGGESTED. THE TREND IS THE SAME FOR BOTH, THE

01FFERENCE IN DEGREE PROBABLY BEING DUE TO THE INDIV¬ 
IDUAL CONTROL MECHANISM. IF THIS IS A CORRECT ASSUMP¬ 
TION., THE DIFFICULTY IN REFINING SCREENING METHODS TO 
CATCH UNDESIRABLE POTENTIAL PSYCHOTICS IS OBVIOUS AND 

great. However, this study demonstrates that, as stress 

INCREASES IN A MANNER WHICH IS FELT BY THE INDIVIDUAL, 

BY EXPOSING HIM TO NORTHERN SERVICE CONDITIONS, THE 
HIGHER SCORING MEN (MORE ABNORMAL BY TEST MEASUREMENT) 
LOSE EFFICIENCY FASTER. 

IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE, THAT SOME GRADUATION 
CAN BE MADE AT THE PSYCHOTIC END OF THE PROFILE BETWEEN 
SOLDIERS WHO REMAIN IN SUFFICIENTLY GOOD PERSONAL ADJ¬ 
USTMENT TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH, AND THOSE WHO DETER¬ 
IORATE TO THE POINT WHERE THEIR PERFORMANCE IS ONLY 
FAIR OR POOR. THE DIVIDING LINE CAN BE FAIRLY SPECIFIC 
ON A STATISTICAL BASIS, BUT WOULD REQUIRE CLINICAL 
CHECKING OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN PRACTICAL APPLICATION. 

Testing material could be sharpened to a point where 

IT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE AS A GENERAL INDICATOR OF 
RECRUITS REQUIRING SPECIAL EVALUATION BEFORE ACCEPTANCE. 

The obvious weakness of a test of this 

NATURE FOR PREDICTIVE WORK IS THE SIZE OF THE OVER- 




-62- 

LAP BETWEEN GRADED GROUPS. MANY GOOD MEN WOULD BE 
LOST IF TEST RESULTS ALONE WERE USED TO ELIMINATE 
THOSE INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM THE EFFICIENCY PROGNOSIS 
WAS POOR. |N ADDITION THE DEGREE OF n POORNESS n IS 
IMPORTANT, AND DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. 

Against these weaknesses may be matched 

THE OVER-ALL DIFFICULTIES OF OPERATIONS IN THE NORTH. 

Even with highly rated troops, efficiency drops com¬ 
pared WITH PERFORMANCE UNDER MORE FAVOURABLE CONDITIONS. 

Thus morale becomes exceptionally important. Poor 

TROOPS WHO BREAK EARLIER MAY HAVE AN UNUSUALLY GREAT 
EFFECT UPON THEIR BETTER COMRADES. In ADDITION, 
EVACUATION OF CASUALTIES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS, 
ARE MANY TIMES MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN ORDINARY OPER¬ 
ATIONS. Hence, clearing back those who become non- 
effective IS A MAJOR TASK. PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT 
STILL IS THE FACT THAT ONLY SMALL BODIES OF TROOPS 
CAN BE KEPT IN OPERATION FOR VERY HIGH MAINTENANCE 
COST. IF BORDERLINE INDIVIDUALS ARE RETAINED IN THE 
LINE, BUT FUNCTION AT PERHAPS AS LOW AS FIFTY PERCENT 
OF THEIR OPTIMUM, THE POSSIBLE EFFORT OF THE WHOLE 
GROUP IS REDUCED. 

IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT THAT EVEN MINOR 
DIFFERENCES BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DETAILING MEN

FOR DUTY UNDER SUCH STRESSFUL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE 
APPARENT FACT THAT SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE MORE A MATTER 
OF DEGREE ALONG A CONTINUUM, THAN OF CONTRASTING 
PERSONALITY FACTORS, MAKES SOME KIND OF TESTING DEVICE 
A WELCOME ADDITION TO PRESENT SCREENING METHODS. IMPR¬ 
OVEMENT OF INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES, WITH EMPHASIS ON PSY¬ 
CHOTIC SYNDROMES WOULD NO DOUBT BE HELPFUL. HOWEVER, 
AlTA (17) DISCOVERED IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF 3°^ U.S. 

Army inductees that even a psychiatric interview was 

INADEQUATE BY ITSELF FOR SCREENING PURPOSES. HE CON¬ 
CLUDED THAT BETTER RESULTS WOULD BE ARRIVED AT BY A 
COMBINATION OF TEST AND INTERVIEW PROCEDURES. 

COMPARI SONS : 

Blair’s study of army delinquents lends 

ITSELF MOST READILY TO COMPARISON WITH THIS WORK 
BECAUSE HE DEALS WITH ESSENTIALLY THE SAME GROUP OF 
MEN. HE HAS MADE A DIFFERENT BREAKDOWN BY CONSID¬ 
ERING DISCIPLINARY NON-EFFECTIVES. AGAIN THE DIS¬ 
TINCTIVE Canadian soldier pattern appears, with low 
NEUROTIC TRIAD AND PEAKS ON PD AND SC . THERE IS A 
NOTICEABLE RISE ON D, BUT THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE A 
NORMAL INCLUSION WITH THE PD OR SC INDIVIDUAL WHO

FINDS HIMSELF IN DETENTION. THE GRAPHICAL COMPARISON 


OF HIS DELINQUENTS WITH THE CANADIAN SOLDIER IS SHOWN 
IN FlGURE 13« 

Superimposed on the same graph, is the pro¬ 
file DERIVED BY CLARK (4) FOR U.S. ARMY AWOLS. THERE 
IS A STRIKING DIFFERENCE IN THE NEUROTIC AREAS AS DES¬ 
CRIBED BY THE TEST. AMERICAN DELINQUENTS AS OPPOSED 
TO ALL GROUPS OF CANADIAN SOLDIERS, SHOW HIGH NEUROTIC 
TENDENCIES. THE PSYCHOTIC TRENDS ARE SIMILAR TO THE 

Canadian offender group. When compared with the U.S. 

SOLDIER NORM AS DERIVED BY SCHMIDT (3)j THERE IS A 
STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE. 

It is quite obvious that present selection 

PROCEDURES IN THE CANADIAN ARMY ELIMINATE THE MEN 
WHO SCORE HIGH ON THE NEUROTIC TRAITS MEASURED BY THE 

MMPI. There is no evidence at present that potential 

PSYCHOTICS CAN BE DETECTED AS POSSIBLE UNSUCCESSFUL 

soldiers. Indeed, the 0 / S group of soldiers are 

SUFFICIENTLY HIGH ON SOME PSYCHOTIC SCALES THAT IT 
WILL BE DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL 
HAS JUST ENOUGH TENDENCY TOWARDS PD OR Sc TO MAKE 
HIM A GOOD SOLDIER, OR WHETHER HE HAS OVER-SHOT THE 
MARK AND SHOULD BE RATED AS A POOR PROSPECT.

CONCLUSIONS 


General : 

Using a group of 600 operational Canadian 

TROOPS, IT IS FOUND THAT THE TYPICAL CANADIAN SOLDIER 
DIFFERS MARKEDLY IN PERSONALITY STRUCTURE, AS MEAS¬ 
URED BY THE MMPI, FROM BOTH THE CANADIAN MALE CIVILIAN, 

and the American civilian and soldier. In attempting 

TO MEASURE PERSONALITY, IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE 
THIS POINT AND PROVIDE A VALID NORM FOR THE GROUP 
UNDER STUDY. USING THE MMPI A PROFILE HAS BEEN 
DERIVED SHOWING THE SOLDIER WITH PEAK POINTS ON THE 

scales: F, Pd, and Sc. 

Using over-all efficiency as the criterion, 

THERE IS A RELIABLE STATISTICAL DIFFERENCE ON THE PD 
AND SC SCALES BETWEEN SOLDIERS GRADED OUTSTANDING OR 

Superior and those graded Fair or Poor. This is 

HELPFUL IN GENERALIZING AS TO TREND TOWARDS THE 
ABNORMAL, BUT IT IS QUESTIONABLE IF TEST RESULTS 
WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN PREDICTIVE WORK AT DEPOTS. THE 
BEST VALUE MIGHT BE RECEIVED FROM SUCH TESTS IF COM¬ 
BINED WITH A PERSONNEL OFFICER*S INTERVIEW AND JUDICIAL 
REFERRAL FOR CLINICAL SCREENING ON A PSYCHIATRIC LEVEL. 

The fact that this test, on a statistical

BASIS, DISCRIMINATES AT SOME POINTS BETWEEN BOTH 

Blair’s delinquent group and the Canadian Soldier, 

AND HIGH-, AND LOW-RATED SOLDIERS BY AN EFFICIENCY 
CRITERION IS INDEED INTERESTING. THE INTEREST IS - 
HEIGHTENED WHEN IT IS OBSERVED THAT THE DELINQUENT, 
AND LOW-RATED, GROUPS ARE BOTH SIMILAR IN THAT THEY 
ARE COMPARATIVELY LOW AT THE NEUROTIC END OF THE 
PROFILE AND HIGH AT THE PSYCHOTIC END. IT APPEARS 
LOGICAL THEN TO CONCLUDE THAT SELECTION DEVICES IN 

the Canadian Army have screened out neurotics from 

THE GROUP. 

Again it seems proper to conclude that high 

SCORING INDIVIDUALS BECOME MALADJUSTED MORE QUICKLY 
THAN LOWER SCORING MEN. UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES 
THEY BECOME DELINQUENTS, UNDER OTHERS SUCH AS NOR¬ 
THERN SERVICE CONDITIONS THEY LOSE EFFICIENCY. CER¬ 
TAINLY THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THESE PROJECTS 
TO WARRANT CONTINUED RESEARCH TO IMPROVE SCREENING 
TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO REDUCE WASTAGE IN ADVANCED 
TRAINING. 

Some mention is necessary here of the 

CONTINUAL HIGH SCORES ON THE F SCALE. THE TEST 
MANUAL DESCRIBES TWO TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY 



- 68 - 


BE HIGH VALIDLY ON THIS SCALE; THE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL 
AND INDEPENDENT MAN, OR A BADLY PSYCHOTIC SUBJECT. 

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE SOLDIER COULD QUITE REASON¬ 
ABLY FIT EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF THE SUGGESTED TYPES. 

Hence it has been assumed that high F scores are 

NORMAL ADJUNCTS TO PEAKS ON THE PD AND Sc SCALES. 

It IS NOT CLEAR THAT NORTHERN ENVIRONMENT 
WAS THE ONLY FACTOR CAUSING LOSS OF EFFICIENCY AMONG 
OTHERWISE WELL-ADJUSTED SOLDIERS. HOWEVER, THE CON¬ 
DITIONS UNDER WHICH THE EXERCISE TOOK PLACE CERTAINLY 
PLACED ADDITIONAL STRESS ON THE INDIVIDUAL. IT 
WOULD APPEAR LIKELY THAT A TEST SIMILAR TO THE MMPI 
MIGHT BE DEVISED WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A GENERAL INDI¬ 
CATION OF INDIVIDUALS MOST LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE 
DIFFICULTY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ADDITIONAL STRAIN OF 
SUCH SERVICE. 

Future Research : 

It is obvious that further work should be 
directed towards sharpening devices for detecting 

POTENTIAL PSYCHOTICS BEFORE THEY REACH A TRAINING 
ENVIRONMENT WHICH FORCES A BREAKDOWN. SERVICE CON¬ 
DITIONS ARE SUCH THAT CUMBERSOME METHODS MUST BE

AVOIDED. The testing field is a likely source for 
GENERALIZED INDICATION OF ABNORMALITY. COMBINATIONS 
OF TESTS WITH CLINICAL INTERVIEWS SHOULD PROVIDE 
VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR SCREENING PURPOSES. 

A PERSONALITY TEST WITH SIMILAR MATHE¬ 
MATICAL DESCRIPTIVE DEVICES TO THE MMPI MIGHT BE 
ASSEMBLED AND STANDARDIZED FOR THE SPECIFIC USE OF 

Service personnel. All operational exercises might 

BE STUDIED AS WAS SWEETBRIAR WITH THE OBJECT OF 
COLLECTING STATISTICS AS TO THE RELATIONSHIPS OF 
PERSONALITY COMPOSITE TO SUCCESS AS A SOLDIER. 

It is probable too, THAT helpful information 

WOULD BE DISCOVERED BY TESTING ALL CASUALTIES, MEDICAL 
OR ADMINISTRATIVE AT THE TIME OF THEIR EVACUATION FROM 
AN OPERATIONAL ROLE. 

The RELATIONSHIP OF DELINQUENCY AND INEFF¬ 
ICIENCY IS A RELATED STUDY WHICH COULD ADVANTAGEOUSLY 
BE EXPLORED MUCH FURTHER THAN HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED HERE. 

If at any TIME A WAR BROKE OUT WHICH necess¬ 
itated EMPLOYMENT OF TROOPS IN THE NORTH, IT IS CON¬ 
SIDERED ESSENTIAL THAT SOME PLAN BE DEVISED WHEREBY 
INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTMENT TO THE UNUSUAL SERVICE CONDITIONS 
COULD BE STUDIED INTENSIVELY. SUCH AN UNDERTAKING, 
DESPITE THE MANY DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED, WOULD BE WELL

worth-while IN TERMS OF MANPOWER SAVING AND RESULTING 
OVER-ALL EFF ICI ENCY . 

Summary : 

A CHARACTERISTIC PROFILE USING THE MINNESOTA 

Multiphasic Personality Inventory has been derived 
for the Canadian soldier. It has been concluded that 
present screening devices eliminate potential neurotics 

SAT I SFACTOR I LY, BUT THAT POTENTIAL PSYCHOTICS ARE NOT 
DETECTED. BOTH GOOD AND POOR SOLDIERS REGISTER DEVI¬ 
ATION FROM n NORMAL n ALONG THE pD AND Sc SCALES OF THE 
TEST, THE DIFFERENCE BEING ONE OF DEGREE. THE EFFECT 
OF THE NORTHERN SERVICE CONDITIONS WAS NOT NECESSARILY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE OF 

groups. Further research along similar lines is neces¬ 
sary AND IS CONSIDERED WELL WORTH-WHILE.

GUIDE TO RATING SHEET 

TO CHECK THE VALUE OF THE TESTS USED IN THE 
EXPERIMENT, IT IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN FOR EACH SUBJECT 
A MEASURE OF HIS SUCCESS IN LIFE AND DUTY IN THE NORTH. 

Supervising Officers are therefore asked to rate each 

MAN WHO TAKES THE TESTS IN ALL THE FOLLOWING QUALITIES: 

1. CO N SC I ENT IOUSNESS - THE MA N * S ATTITUDE TO HIS JOB. 

High ratings would be given to reliable, careful, hard 

WORKING SOLDIERS. 

2. Initiative - the man’s ability to see the job and do 
it. High ratings would be given to men who try to solve 
problems for themselves, take responsibility, and try to 
DO the job without waiting for instructions. 

3 . Co-OPERAT 1 ON - THE MAN’S ATTITUDE TO HIS FELLOWS AND 

NCC’s. High ratings would be given to soldiers who take 

SUGGESTIONS FROM COMRADES IN GOOD PART, HELP OTHERS, AND 
TAKE ORDERS AND CRITICISMS FROM SUPERVISORS WELL. 

4. Health - the man's physical condition and stamina. 
High ratings would be given to men seldom or never absent 

FROM DUTY BECAUSE OF ILL HEALTH. 

5 . Flex 1 b ility - the ease with which the man can adjust 
to change. High ratings would be given to men who can 

CHANGE FROM ONE JOB OR LOCATION TO ANOTHER EASILY, AND 


SETTLE DOWN QUICKLY 

















- 3 - 


6. Intelligence - the man's potential ability, without 

REGARD TO HIS ACTUAL PERFORMANCE. HIGH RATINGS WOULD BE 
GIVEN TO MEN WHO CAN LEARN QUICKLY AND REMEMBER WELL, 
CONTRIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEMS OF EVERY-DAY LIFE, 

AND ARE GENERALLY SHREWD AND CAPABLE. 

7 * Over-all efficiency - the man's actual performance 
ON THE job. High ratings would BE given to men in whom 

THERE WAS THE BEST BALANCE OF THE ABOVE QUALITIES AND ANY 
OTHER IMPORTANT ASSETS, IN ORDER TO PRODUCE CONSISTENT 
GOOD WORK. 

8. Popularity - the attitude of the man's associates 
toward him. High ratings would be given to men who 
make friends easily in the unit, and are well liked both 
on and off duty. 

9- Dl SPQ SIT1 ON - THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT. HIGH RATINGS 
WOULD BE GIVEN TO CHEERFUL, AGREEABLE, EVEN-TEMPERED MEN. 

10. Over-all social adjustment - the man's reaction to 

LIFE IN THE NORTH, AND PARTICULARLY TO SOCIAL CONDITIONS. 

High ratings would be given to men who seem to like the 
North, fit themselves to the social life of the camp, 

AND TRY TO GET ALONG WITH THEIR ASSOCIATES. 

Ratings should be made on the accompanying 

RATING SHEET. OPPOSITE THE NAME OF THE MAN, RATINGS 
SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE VARIOUS COLUMNS, WHICH ARE NUM-

BERED AND MARKED WITH ABBREVIATIONS TO CORRESPOND 
WITH THE QUALITIES LISTED ABOVE. THE LETTERS 
WHICH FORM THE RATINGS SHOULD BE ENTERED ACCORDING 
TO THE FOLLOWING CODE: 

0 - Outstanding; among the top 5 $ 

S - Superior; among the next 25$ 

G - Good; one of the middle 40$ 

F - Fair; among the next 25$ 

P - Poor; among the bottom 5$ 

Each man should be rated in comparison 

WITH THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF OTHER WORKERS WHOM 
THE OFFICER HAS SEEN WORKING ON COMPARABLE JOBS. 

The FIGURES SHOWN IN THE FIVE GROUPS IN WHICH THE 
RATINGS FALL ARE BASED ON ACTUAL STUDIES OF WORKERS 
IN ORDINARY JOBS; IN ANY LARGE GROUPS THE BULK OF 
THE WORKERS ARE GOOD, SOLID, SATISFACTORY MEN, AND 
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW REALLY GOOD OR REALLY BAD 

workers. But groups in the North are likely to be 

small; AND AN OFFICER MAY FIND THAT MEN WORKING 
UNDER HIM NOW DO NOT FALL INTO GROUPS IN THE PRO¬ 
PORTIONS SHOWN ABOVE. To CORRECT FOR THIS, EACH 


OFFICER SHOULD RATE HIS MEN IN COMPARISON WITH ALL

THE WORKERS HE HAS EVER SEEN IN COMPARABLE JOBS, OUT¬ 
SIDE the North as well as in it. 

Officers should strive to make their ratings 

CAREFULLY AND ACCURATELY. THEY SHOULD TRY TO FORGET 
PERSONAL LIKES AND DISLIKES. THEY SHOULD CONSIDER 
EACH M A N 1 S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SEPARATELY, AND 
TRY TO AVOID THE BIAS WHICH COMES WHEN THE RATING ON 
SOME OBVIOUS CHARACTERISTIC IS TAKEN AS TYPICAL OF 
ALL OTHER QUALITIES. ABOVE ALL, OFFICERS SHOULD TRY 
TO SPREAD THEIR RATINGS IN THE VARIOUS GROUPS, 

ROUGHLY ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE SHOWN. IF AN 
OFFICER MARKS MOST OF HIS MEN 11 F W OR "P" ON MOST 
QUALITIES, IT MAY BE BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN UNLUCKY 
ENOUGH TO GET AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF LOW-GRADE 
MEN. But IT IS PERHAPS MORE LIKELY THAT HE HAS BEEN 
TOO SEVERE IN HIS RATINGS, AND IS COMPARING HIS MEN 
AGAINST AN IDEAL WORKER, RATHER THAN WITH THE ACTUAL 
PERFORMANCE OF MEN IN HIS OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.
