CIUPTKH II 

In ancient times the precursor of this modem movement 
seems to have been the Stoic philosophy. For it stresses 
man*s worth and the science of mn*s behavior more than the 
activity of God. Stoicism bloomed in fourth centuiy Greece. 

It was a philosopliy that aimed and tiiat in no uncertain way 
to stem the rising tide of moral deterioration. Its hlstoiy 
may be divided into three periods* Firsts there is the period 
of the early iitoa. ^eno, reputed to be the founder of this 
school, was not a Greek but a Saaite by birth, thus at once 
one smells a non-Grecian odor* ^©no*s lifenvas simple and 
austere. He vms quite a bit of an eclectic. For, from the 
Qynics he drew his eonterrpt for pleasure; from the Begaries, 
his doctrine of ^apatheia’; from Plato, many of his leading 
ethical tenets; from Heraeleitus, the physical groundwork of 
his universe; from Aristotle, his logical criterion. With 
Zeno Stoicisra was found in its primeval sternness, and 
exclusiveness. Gleanthes revolutionised the study of physics 
by the theory of tension and the development of pantheism. 
Chr^.'sippus developed Stoic logic and dialectic as a mode of 
defence against other systems. 

There are two outstanding figures among the 
transitional or middle 3toa. Panaetius of idiodes (180-111 
B. C. ] made Stoic ethics v^orkable, giving indifferent” things 
a really helpful place in the formation of character. He

denied divination, and brought atoic views of the gods up- 
to-date. Posidonius (b. 1S5 B. C.) of Syria, like Panaetius, 
was an eclectic and had a direct influence on certain 
distinguished Homans. 

In the Homan period three Stoic names were famous. 
Seneca (3-65J was a tutor of Hero. He made ethics supreme, 
insisted on the depravity of human nature, and held evil to 
be disciplinary suffering. Epictetus was a lame, ill- 
treated slave of purest life. He advocated a life according 
to nature and he eii^hasized the stern observance of duty* 

His book, the Encheiridion, is still read. Marcus Aurelius 
(131-180) was at the same time a great en^eror, and an austere 
individual. Henan says of him that he was a '’high moral 
conscience placed face to face with the universe"’. Others, 
after reading his ’Meditations’, have said that his is a 
philosophy with ”no personal God, no future lif‘e, no super¬ 
natural but morality in its virgin purity, independent of 
and unassisted by considerations of heaven or of hell, with 
a metaphysic definite enough to rescue it from being 
absolutely vague, yet not so precisely defined as to become 
dogmatic.” (Davidson: "fhe Stoic Creed, page 239J. 

Stoic philosophy was a unifying science that sought 
to know things by their causes and that did not in any way 
oppose either physical or mental science. Yet there were 
inconsistencies in this philosophical system. The early 
Stoics suppressed all emotions and upheld absolute virtue, 
while the later Stoics allowed a little for emotion and 






5 


claimed that there were degrees of virtue. But, more 
fundamentally, its physics and its ethics did not ali/ays 
agree. For, the physics supposed a material^ impersonal 
Grod, while the ethics often seem to have supposed a personal 
Grod. I’he constituent sciences of Stoic philosophy were 
logic, ethics, and physics. 

Logic, the otoic divided into three parts: rhetoric, 
formal logic and epistemology. Of the first two, the Stoic 
said little but of the third he said much* For him the mind 
was, at birth, a ^tabula rasa’. It acquired knowledge by 
means of "apprehending representations", which, said Sentus 
Iiimpiricus (Adv. llath. vii* 248) are " representations 
proceeding from the object and agreeing with it, etaii^ed and 
sealed upon the soul, such as could have no existence but for 
the existence of the object." But there were also "comon 
notions" in the mind. Davidson says of "eoMaon notions"; 

"'j?he conception that underlies this se^s to be, that the 
minds of men are formed according to one definite plan - a 
plan that unfolds itself as the individual’s e^^erience grows", 
(page 69). Yet it must be remembered that these were not 
innate ideas, that they were not full-grown at birth* The 
test that proved the existence of these "eoaaaaon notions" was 
the ’consensus gentium*. 

Ethics was the point of Stoic empiiasis. The body, 
they held, was a hindrance to moral perfection. Yet they 
took care not to be repellent in their bodily habits as were 
many of the Cynics. Pleasure x^as certainly not to them the

'sumimum bonum^. Hather they eiiphaslzed the fleetingness 
of life and taught a stern indifference to pain and pleasure. 
One of their central ethical words w’as ’’apatheia”. This 
meant, for the Stoic, a life inwardly self-sufficient which 
would he absolutely unmoved by external accidents. Emotions, 
they taught, v/ere to be subjugated, and it were best often 
even to eradicate them - though in some of the later Stoics 
we can sniff a faint emotional smell. Things that were not 
v/ithin their po?/er, in the sense that they depended on chance, 
the Stoics taught themselves to sit loose to and to use them 
as things indifferent'' - yet later Stoics came to think that 
some of these ’’indifferent things” were to be ”preferred”, 
while others were to be ’’avoided”. Their supx*eme indifference 
to death led to their enunciation of the doctrine of the ’’open 
door” or of justifiable suicide. Marcus Aurelius wrote 
regarding this ”The cabin smokes - so I take leave of it”. 

Duty was for the otoic another key-word in ethics. He 
was taught to live agreeably to nature both in the sense of 
conforming himself to the course of the universe and in the 
sense of recognizing the true values in life. This was to be 
done by the power of individual ?/ills. Virtue consisted In 
moral insight and in practice based on that insight. And 
virtue is absolute as is vice. The men possessing virtue 
are ’’wise” and the mass that do not possess it are ”foolish”, 
and there is no way in which the ’’foolish” may become ”wise”. 
Yet some of the later Stoics modified their views on this 
matter and allowed that there were degrees of virtue and of 



7 


vicG and that it was possible for the ”foolish'’ to heeome 
’’wise”. There were no external rev/ards for virtue hut it 
was its omi reward. Virtue was taught by the lives of the 
moral heroes of the past and by the people then living i^’ho 
were perfectly moral. 

In its altruism, Stoicism taught the solidarity of 
the race and was probably the first truly coaraopolitan ethici 

For the Stoic the study of physics probably really 
meant cosmology* Their pilmitive substance was fire, 
understood as a sublimated all-pervasive essence or ether, and 
as such was eteryial and was equated with deity. They 
conceived of the evolution of the world in the following way. 
The fiery vapor became moisture. The- moisture condensed and 
out of the condeiised moistui*e were formed the four elements - 
fire, water, air and earth. These intermingled to produce 
the individual things. And the individual things contain 
the divine substance in varying degrees. In inoi'ganie matter 
it i-yas ’’hold” or cohesion. In plants it was vital force. In 
animals it was the irrational soul. In man, finally, it was 
the X’ational soul or immanent divine reason. The i^orld, once 
evolved, moved in cycles. It came from God, coii^leted its 
course, then was absorbed in God by means of a conflagration. 

How let us look at Stoic theology. In a v^^ord or two 
it may be defined as a dynamic materialism. For deity was 
thought to be the primitive fire. Yet the deity was not only 
the source of the universe but as divine reason vms also its 
sustainer. The Stoics conceived tiiat God was limited by fate.

Yet they never obtruded this concept into the ethical field. 
And, further, this probably was their way of saying that all 
things must happen according to law and order, that not even 
God v;as able to oppose natural lav/. For them, too, God was 
very iinwanent in his universe, but the element of transcend¬ 
ence seems to have be,en almost entirely lacking in their 
theology. 

Man could not be an agnostic. For the deity was 
immanent as ujiiversal reason and so v/as necessarily in 
contact with the reason of man which shared pre-eminently 
in the divine reason. 2?he Stoics had, also, a doctrine of 
providence. The course of ^the worlds said they, was 
teleologically determined since the divine reason had 
foreseen and prearranged all* Since God cared for the whole 
universe, he eared also for man since man was a part of the 
whole and, therefore, Iran’s circTOstaneeB are in the hand 
of the deity. For the problesi of evil the Stoics had many 
solutionso To Epictetus, evil was only apparent. To 
Chrysippus aM Cleanthes it was good in disguise. To Seneca 
it was a disciplinary necessity* To others it mrs made 
necessary by the theory of relativity, since good must be 
good in contrast to an opposite* Stoic ritual Included 
divination and prayer. Divination to the Stoic probably 
meant either God speaking through the conscience or probably 
it is the only valid aelcnowledgement of the existence of the 
supernatural that we find in Stoicism. Divination, they 
divided into two kinds - artificial and natural. Artificial

divination had its source in e 3 q)erienee, hut natural 
divination cane in dreams and visions - in it the prophet 
spoke from touch with the divine. „ As to prayer, the "wise”, 
said the Stoics, prayed to God. And the ideal puorpose of 
prayer was, through it,.to ho freed from desire., 

V/as the Stoic God personal or impersonal? Surely in 
their physics where the deity was ethereal fire, it vms 
impersonal. Indeed the cosmos here was used indifferently 
to mean the ordered universe or God., But Stoic ethics were 
not ruled hy Stoic physics.. Among certain Stoics, as time 
passed, the conception of divine personality as distinct 
from the universe became more and more articulate., till in 
Epictetus v;e find the language of fervent theism. Yet 
pantheism remained the doctrine of maijy. Marcus Aurelius 
may he said to have been a spiritual pantheist. Ills 
pantheism, says Davidson, freference ommittedi was '^haaed on 
the rationality of the all intellectually conceived”, 
frohahly most often the Stoic deity was i%3eraonal and 
iimmnent hut neither supra-personal nor transcendent. It was 
the notion of a supreme all-i)erm.eating and all-*coraprehending 
essence that stimulated the Stoic and gave imptO.se to his 
aspirations. 

In Stoicism we find a fine humaiiisra* ?he Stoic 
appreciated man*s dignity and worirth. fhei^efore he cultivated 
self-respect and an independent spirit. ITurthemore, he 
regarded self-respect as the foundation of all virtue. But, 
in Stoicism ethics and religion are I'^/edded inseparably. For,

the hindingriGsa of morality on the Stoic was the bindingnesa 
of rationality, reproducing the divine reason* And hirnian 
laws were to be obeyed since they v/ere the embodiments of ' 
the universal reason and subservient to the intei*ests of the 
whole. This conception became with the Stoics a living and 
an operative principle. 

Certainly Stoicism was not a positive non-theistic 
humanism, , Yet it showed a drift towards an impersonal God 
and towards an immanent God that was not at the same time 
transcendent. 






cmpa?iin? iii 


Towards the close of the ancient or Greek period of 
philosophy an absolute scepticism appeared. Its devotees 
asserted that there was no criterion of truth either in 
perception or thought or any\¥here else* Thus, for them, the 
correct attitude to life was one of absolute doubt* They 
obviously could have believed in neither God nor man. 

Science forged forward, led by luelid in the mathematical 
sphere and by Ptol^ny in the astronomical* When Home had 
become a mighty world power, eclectism was a commoB attitude 
toward philosophy as well as toward religion* In Gicero this 
syncretistic temper was a dominant eharacteristiCi But more 
interesting, from a religious point of view, wbb Philo’s 
attempt to unite Jewish religious thought and Greek 
philosophy in the doctrine of the as the Mediator 

of God’s revelation of himself* Here God atood apart from 
the world in ineffable, and tmthJjikable perfection, almost 
absolutely transcendent* 

The ”Greek'’ period, ho?^ever, eloaed with a religious 
wave of thought. Men began to feel a conaciousness of evil 
and a consequent need for salvation* do the practical side 
of philosophy ima emphasized. The later Stoic emphasized 
the religious side of their creed, giving Mature more the 
character of a God y/lth whom man could enter into an emotional 
relationship; and a more human attitude toward their fellows

took the place of the hard self-righteousness of the older 
Stoic. Plato was revived in IJeo-Platonism. Here Plotinus 
(E04-269} was the great thinker. For him there was a 
pantheistic absorption of all things in one Absolute or Grod. 
who transcended everything that roan could say or think. For 
Plotinus dualism between spirit aM matter was resolved by 
the assertion that matter is not or laeks being, fhe gap 
between spiritual reality and the mterial world was filled 
by a ’’logos" doctrine. Finite existence was due to a 
progressive falling a?/ay from an original perfection, which 
nevertheless left the original perfection ooniplete. Salvation 
was found only in a mystic or toaediate union with God. fhis 
philosophy really banished nature and natural law. And non- , 
physical agencies were used to explain, events and often in a 
fantastic way. 

But, Feo-Platonlsm the last of the so-called "pagan" 
syst^^B was supplanted by Christianity. At first Christianity 
was not a philosophy but a life. It overflowed with a free 
spirit of devotion. In the constructive and formative period 
of early Christian thought, many "hereEles" were entertained 
for a while then rejected as perverting the ti’uth. One of the 
chief of these was Cnostieieu ?/hich made the essential thing, 
in the religious life, a superior and esoteric Icnoifledge. 

Soon, therefore, dogma entered the church courts and free 
faith fled. For Christian truth came by revelation and that 
a single historical revelation in Jesus Christ. Evil was

explained ly the freedom of will given hy (Jod to man, to 
ehoDoe right or ’wrong. Dualism of mind and matter was 
overcome by the dogma that God created the world out of 
nothing. Individuals were valued very highly. And the 
ideal man came to he that one which was filled with God*s 
spirit. God was now definitely pex^sonal and personally 
related to every believer, ‘rhe belief in persorial iiiMor- 
tality was held to be a necessary corollary of God’s 
interest in the individual soul. Augustine (564-430), one 
of the "church fathers" held that all reality must be 
interi)reted on the basis of the self as an active will. In 
religion, God became for Augustine the great Law-giver end 
Judge. Between a righteous God and a wicked human race a 
mediator was needed. And in the Church Augustine found 
that mediator* For, the Church gave him an Infallible 
system of doctrine, based upon authority, and satisiying his 
religious needs, ilor can man be sav’ed except through the 
Church since all men are bom in sin due to the sin of Adam, 
and since God’s gift of grace is ministered only through the 
Church, 

With Augustine creative Christian thought ended. For 
the coming of the barbarian gave to the Church a task that 
occupied it for maiiy centuries, that of effecting the 
training by external authority of barbarian Durope. fhe 
mediaeval world inherited its thought from the Greeks, its 
government and its laiv from the Homans, its sexme of the 
value of the individual and of the emotions came from

Ohristianity^ and the Greman with his sense of individuality 
and with his love of freedom formed the material with which 
the mediaeval Church worked. Against the threatening 
barharian anarchy only a stx’ong eceleoiastical organization 
and a definitely fomulated creed could avail. The Church, 
therefore, became the arbiter of intellectual beliefs and 
the stabilizing force behind governraent and law. An 
ecclesiastical prejudice arose against Greek and Roman 
philosophy and the intellectual life of antiquity seemed 
about to be eclipsed. 

Mediaeval philosophy vmB known as scholasticism and 
it was the philosophy of dogmatic religion, asseirting that 
certain subject matter must be accepted as absolute and 
unquestioned* It became the systematizer and the ration¬ 
alizer of religious dogma* Irigeiia (about 810-880} was the 
chief exponent of the theory knumi as Realism, by ^fiieh 
individuals exist only in the class, and not by themselves - 
that is, the universals, or abstract notions, are the reality 
and not the particular things* The logical tendency of 
Realism was towards Spirltualiam and towards Pantheism, Blnee 
God, the highest eorcept, was the sole reality, in whom all 
lesser fS.ets - the world and man - have being* Hoscellinus 
?/as one of the exponents of the opposing theory of ifominalism, 
v/hleh declared that the imiversal, class or concept is 
nothing but a name applicable to a number of particular things 
and that the particular thirgs are the only true realities. 
This theory tended toward Materialism and llatui^alism. Anselm

(1035-1109) propounded the ontological argument for the 
existence of Ood* Ood existed for Anseli?i because in the 
mind of man-there was the idea of ’'a being than which 
nothing greater can be thought/’ (Rogers: A Stiident’s 
History of Philosophy, p. 210) but this is Anselm’s 
definition of Ood and Ood to be this must exist outside 
the mind as well as within. Oamiilo, however, answered 
Anselm, saying that this argimient was based only upon the 
ideas of perfection and of existence end did not prove 
anything about an ob.jeetive reality corresponding to these 
ideas. After Anselm a division oeeurred among mediaeval 
thinhers. I’^stieism, especially with St, Bernard of 
Clairvau::^ (1091-1153)* through its immediate union with Ood 
cultivated freedom and spontaneity in the religious life, 
While ^Nationalism had a pure interest in dialectical and 
logical skill for its ovm sake. Its chief e:s3Dnent was 
Abelard flO?9-114E}. Conceptualism, as held by Abelard, 

Biay be said to have been a corollary of Rationalism. *Phe 
concept or class term existed, for Abelard, in particular 
things as a similarity or identity of qualities. Although 
in a certain sense the cDnecpt existed, independently of 

j.. 

things, as an idea in the mind of Cod. Abelard att^mapted 
also to establish a theory of ethics Independent of dogmatic 
sanctions. Horeover, he also treated many particiilar dogmas 
naturalistieally. 

After the rise of the Hoorish influence in Spain and 
aft.er the leaven of the Crusades, Aristotle was e.rowned

dictator of mediaeval ijhilosophy- He, indeed, v/aa the aoui’ce- 
hook fo 2 ’ all thinga, including even science. ^Ehoiiias Aquinas 
(1225-1274) placed revelation above reason^ claiming that 
certain realms cannot he known by the intellect of man. But 
he maintained tliat intellect v/as the supreme element in God. 
Duns 3 cot us, on the other hand, clairsed tiiat God’s will was 
sui^reme and tiiat therefore 'the realia of super-^sensible things 
could not be Icnown by the natural reason since it rested upon 
the inscrutable will of God. HeasDri, then., could Imow only 
the natui^l world, fhue ?/er6 natural and supernatural 
separated and philosophy is confined to the physical world. 
V/illiam of Occam reasserted the old nominalissi, insisting 
upon the reality of particular things and thus jiietifiring 
the growing scientific spirit in its exclusive atteBtlon to 
facts. Boger Bacon (1214-1294} introduced the inductive 
method of reasoning, developed the study of mathematics, 
stressed the use of e:xperiments and foreshadowed the rule 
of science, 

fhe Ren^aissanoe brought to 'Europe a revival of ancient 
civilication, an absorbing interest in seienee and discovery, 
and a delight in human beings and in human vsluea. It tau^t 
men to live in this world and not to -exist 'waiting for their 
entrance into the next. In religion, it preached justification 
by faith and it appealed to individiml i 2 rimeclis.te Christian 
esperienee - thus it v/as a revolt against ehuroh authority 
and dogma. Copernicus shifted the centre of the universe from 
our earth and thus confused the geography of the s'piritual 
world and forced men to attain to a deeper conception of God

if they were still to have an understandable God. Montaigne 
in his essays completely separated himself from ecclesiastical 
influence and secularized human life and interests* Bruno 
(1548-1600) maintained that a world-soul permeated everything 
so that the vhole was unified and there was no division 
between sacred and secular. But God iras not merely an 
abstract form of unity but a v/hole which was present in its 
coi! 5 )leteness in each part - this was practically pantheism.. 
Paracelsus and his like sought to obtain control over nature 
through the possession of some secret ¥/isdom. Alchemy and 
kindred sciences were the result. Francis Bacon (1561-1636) 
laid his stress upon man. His method that of induction 
and experiment. He divided the world of speculation into 
two elements, fheology and faith, only, could deal ¥/ith God 
and His purposes or the ultimate destiny of man. The rest 
was the province of reason. However, a contes^lation of the 
world may be made to refute atheism. Bacon dealt almost 
entirely with those speculative questions which were within 
the realm of reason. Hobbes was the advocate of a mechanical 
materialism and of naturalistic and social ethics, yet he 
claimed that the religion of the Established Church of England 
must be accepted on authority since it was a necessity of 
civil order - though one might belive in one^s heart whatever 
one pleased as long as one kept it to one’s self. I’hus, 

Hobbes saw the necessity for theistie religion for others 
as a social unit though he probably had no real belief in it

i/hat is termed modern philosophy “began with Descartes 
(159G-1650). Descartes, the first of the modera nationalist 
school, found, as his basic reality, the existence of the 
self, think, therefore I existGod existed for 
Descartes because an innate idea bore witness to His 
existence. God vms the only true substance and He was the 
cause of the other two - mind or thought and matter or 
extension, which had no kinship with each other. Yet the 
physical world moved purely meclianieally for the most part. 
Hor Descartes, God ?jas a substance '^infinite, eternal, 
immutable, independent, OBniisefent, omiiipotent"% and 
creator of men,and things. Bius, though Descartes stressed 
reason and psychology yet he kept a real place for God. 
Descartes’ disciples explained the inter-action of mind and 
laatter by Occasionalism* A direct act of God effected an 
alteration in the physical world and moved the human body 
w'henever it moved. Spinosa (163S-1677J made the world a 
unity, though he accepted Descartes’ mechanical view of the 
physical world. For him,. God was the only substance, while 
mind or thought and matter or extension were but His " 
attributes. Since thought and extension are attributes of 
the same thing a definite relat ion will exist beti^een them. 
That which in one light appears as a mode of extension will 
be, in another light, a mode of thought| so the two modes 
will correspond and a coii^jlete and exact parallelism will 
hold between the attributes v/ithout there being any

interaction. Yet Spinoza denied a personal God, the 
government of the u^orld according to purpose, and the freedom 
of the will. God, for Spinoza, became bare abstract 
substance and the only es^planation he gave of the world or 
of God was given by muans of abstraction. So, in many 
particulars, it is difficult to distinguish his theory from 
a thoroughgoing naturalism. Yet in his ’‘lSthics'% Spinoza 
found the sources of man’s bondage in subject ion to the 
emotions which, for Spinoza, is a confused idea, and in 
ignorance of our true end. Salvation came through knowledge 
and tiie final stage was the conception of a i^stical union 
with God through intuitive knowledge and not through emotion. 
Indeed, Spinoza’s God was largely iB^arsonal and rather 
removed from man since the pure meclianical motion of the 
physical ¥/orld seldom needed a God. Leibniz claimed that 
the reality of the world is not matter but monads, which 
are individual things exerting force, and this force fom^ 
in man a dark background of obseiirer cDnselousneas. 

Continuity was secured since the life of each monad is a 
thought life though its thought is coiifuaed and the soul 
differs from the other monads only in degree. lemony was 
preestablished since each monad was created with reference 
to a universal plan - thus ?/as teleology reconciled with 
meelianism. Man, for Leibniz, had freedom to reislize himself 
in his eos^leteness but the only true freedom is to see things 
truly as they exist for God. Evil is an incident in the life 
of the whole necessary to the hipest perfection. God,

responsible only for positive and perfect realities, is not 
responsible for evil which is a negative fact. God, for 
Leibniz, was the power behind the world viho chose the best 
of all possible worlds and whose attitude man should strive 
to attain. 

The second modern school was that of the Empiricism. 
Locke (1632-1704) insisted that mind is a ‘tabula rasa'' at 
birth and that all knowledge is acquired by sensation and 
reflection, ilnoifledge is of ttoee kinds - intuitive, 
demonstrative, sensational. God is laiown by demonstrative 
loiowledge. Man must liave an adequate cauae and the eternal 
reality will possess the powers that man does in a still 
greater m^sure. So a S'apremely powerful, ]mo?#iiig and 
intelligent being exists, Locke maintained also that the 
true ground of morality is the will and law of a God. Thus 
Locke’s God is personal and knowable, Berkeley (16-85-1753) 
as Locke based all knowledge on. senaatlan* He denied- the ■ 
reality of unthinking matter claiming it had no independent 
existence outside of man’s^mind, Kan’s ideas must have 
some cause but an idea cannot cause an idee. So ideas must 
originate in a substance, since this is the other reality 
that man knows. It must be an incorporeal active substance 
since there is no such thing as a corporeal, passive substance. 
Our own will is not equal to this task so it must be some 
other Will,~ God. Man can know God through intellectual 
^perience. Thus did Berkeley remove all the foimdations 
of atheism, and of l^teriallsmw David Hurae (1711-1776) 
denied that ariy spiritual substance existed and claimed

that causation was not a real hypothesis but only the result 
of imagination and belief, fhus, Hume was a sceptic and 
lived on belief not on certainty. Yet he did not necessarily 
think that belief in God was less to be desired than other 
beliefs. 

Hext came the period of the Enli^itemerit. Its aim 
was to study man, not transcendental things. Its one 
undoubted fact was the individual iiiiaself, with his rights 
and his rational powers of understanding. In England, the 
deistic movement grew out of the Isinlighteniaent. God was 
removed as far as possible from the world, and the iiixmediate 
life of men. God had made the universe and set it in motion 
and had also laid dovm certain la?/s of conduct for m® in 
the moral law. But God could only be known in the workings 
of nature, since there is no revelation. Ethics were given 
a foundation independent of theolo^. foundations for 
ethics were found by Cudwforth in the innate ideas of reason; 
by Olarke in eonfomity to the fitness of things independent 
of God’s will; by Shaftesbury, who found ethics to be the 
full expression of human life, in instinctive good taste; by 
Hutcheson in an innate moral sense; by Butler in conscience, 
which, for him, was the voice of God in human life. Pleasure- 
seeking, on the part of the individual, must be subjected to 
some law imposed by God or by the state, so the happiness of 
society was set up as the criterion of the moral act. The 
French Enlightenment directed its interests to huraan problems, 
magnified reason and decried civilization. Its philosophy

was materialism; its psychology, sensationalism; its ethics, 
hedonism; and its religion, atheism. Yet for La Mettrie man 
was an automaton and for Helvetius the only moral motives 
were self-interest and egoism,- so neither had those of the 
Pi*ench Enlightenment much faith in man. Eave Rousseau, who 
"believed that raan was "by nature good. He also believed in 
God, though his religion was based on feeling, not on reason. 

At the close of this period Lessing and Herder in Germany 
discovered the raeaning of the historical* Lessing explained 
religion as a development and found God actually present in 
nature and in human evanta. Herder extended this conception 
of development to cover mauls entire life* 

German Idealism moved bade to a raore positive theism. 

For Kant the synthetic kno?m world was a construat of themght, 
priori” knowledge, absolutely independent of all ax|?erience, 
can be discovered by its necessity and strict universality, 
fhe supersensible world can only be iaiO?m through the moral 
will,- the ”Dught”. Freedom is neceusai^ since the eaeence 
of the moral life consists in obedience to a lai¥; and 
imortality since an endless life is tlmt the 

highest good raay be achieved* God must exist to safeguard the 
moral order of the world. Each a God is purely intelligible 
and free from all intemixture of sens e-content and so is 
beyond the reach of attacks from scientific Biaterialism or

scepticism. Fichte held that the self ih united in all

creation of Spirit, Man aeta up an outer world since, as an 
active moral being, he needs a field of endeavor. For Fichte 
the ^ibsolute iilgo was not a personal God but the moral order 
of the universe. Schelling (1775-1864) tried to point the 
traces of intelligence in natural processes and forms. Hegel, 
(1770-ieSl), held tiiat thought and Heality are identical and 
that thought comes from concrete experietiee. fhus, the 
system of experience itself is reality, is God; and, God is 
the most eertaiii thing in the world. Implicated in the 
existence of any reality whatsoever* 'J!he concept of 
development by thesis, antithesis, and synthesis exi^lained 
for Hegel the factors of experience. But, for Hegel, only 
the Vifhole is real* Man, he claimed, is necessarily social. 

God is equivalent to religious experience* Christlaiiity 
combines the Oriental idea of the Infinite ¥/ith Greek 
naturalism^ placing the infinite in the finite. The History 
of Philosophy, and finally the philosophy of Hegol bring the 
truths shadowed forth in religion to their clear, rational 
statement. 

Schopenhauer (1788-1860] found reality to be Will 
which is one and indivisible. Fux Scl^penteuer all will 
arose from want, and so from deficiency, and so from 
suffering. And if want were satisfied and if comparative 
freedom from pain were to exist, then ennui would appear,- 
so dchopeniiauer was a confirmed pessimist. Yet the deepest 
will in vmn is the will to live, Salvation, for 3chopenhauer, 
lay first tiirough Art which considers only the essential, the

idea. True deliverance comes from rejecting not life, but 
the desire for life - morality founded on sympathy foms 
the step in doing this. The highest ideal is the ascetic 
starvation of all the impulses, which results in the 
attainment of hirvana. God was, for Schopenhauer, the 
world-will. But, both God and xmn are colorless beings.

CHAPl'ER IV 


It v/as, however, Auguste Comte (1798-1857) who first 
enunciated a hold and positive non-theistic humanism. For 
him, metaphysics was not valid and theology was untrue, 

Comte was influenced hy post-revolutionary France, especially 
hy the conservative thinkers who sought to establish and 
maintain an ordered society once more, From De Maistre he 
learned vindication of the mediaeval order; and from Saint- 
Simon he learned the industrial and the spiritual constitution 
of his positive polity. 

In its negative aspects Comtephilosophy was 
agnosticism. For he claimed that any reality heyond 
phenomena and their laws was un3aio?mhle. For him all 
knowledge \iras relative and none absolute. Ho ultimate 
explanation of the universe is possible since man by his 
very constitution is incapable of knowing this* and, since, 
moreover, man’s knowledge is still continuously advancing 
and so cannot yet know perfect or real things, Comte se^ed 
to imply that there is a realm of things-in-themselves. But, 
in addition to being unknowable, this realm is of no use to 
man. For man, knowing the laws of phenomena, especially those 
of his o\¥n nature and environment, knows all that is necessaiy 
for his social welfare. Yet Comte made this one concession 
to the science of origins, that, ?#hereas science now explains

phenomena by general facta, the day may come when it will 
explain them by one general fact auch as, for example, the 
law of gravitation- 

Theology, Corate wholly denied. In the first stage 
of man’s development Cod was used to unite men into a society; 
but with the advent of the age of science, God is proven a 
myth and must be discarded. And with God depart Christianity 
and all other religions. 

But, Comte was a great positive thinker* His aim, x^as 
to further the social well-being of man. He xfould reform 
thought for the sake of action. Thus man and his welfare 
were the centre and goal of Comte’s philosophical endeavors, 

Comteideal polity is based on positive science. 

There is first the road of three stages to science, v/hich 
epitomized the intellectual development of the race and, in 
a sense, of each individual. The first period is the 
theological, in whic^ theological concepts unite men. At 
first deity is ascribed to every object and fetishism results. 
Then objects are gathered together in groups and over each 
group is set a god,- and we have polytheism. Finally all 
objects are brought under one god, who iS: farther axxray than 
were the gods; and we have monotheism, which la the last 
division of the theological stage. Monotheism yields to the 
metaphysical stage. Here the world is at first explained as 
emanating from a number of particular entities; and, later, 
as coming from only one, an abstract Hature - this is a 
period when man’s faith in God goes and when men tend to 



£7 


become even anarchistically individualistic. The third and 
present stage is the scientific. Here all gods and 
abstractions, entities and causes disappear forever from 
man’s horizon and general facts or laws explain phenomena, 
though, eventually, these may be ex^^lained by one general 
fact or law. 

The progress in science v/as for the race and is for 
the individual through a hierarchy. At the base of this 
hierarchy is mathematics, which contains material and method 
fundamental to all positive science. In mathematics one 
climbs from calculus to geometry and from geometry to 
rational mechanics. Hext, are a group of inorganic sciences: 
astronomy, terrestrial physics and chemistry. Then come the 
organic sciences, biology first, followed by sociology, ?/hieh 
Comte in his own day has 3^st made a true science. Later, 
Comte placed morality above sociology as the final science. 
Each science is dependent on the one below and is necessary 
to the one above. All the sciences are vary definitely 
subordinated to man’s social well-being. 

And, Comte has a kind of metaphysics. Hature or the 
natural w^rld is not friendly to man but is rather hostile. 
Man’s only way out is to learn and then to obey the laws of 
phenomena. Yet, in the end, through the mediation of 
Humnity, laan learns from his conflict with nature discipline 
of self and co-operation with his fellov^s. Comte has a 
species of universals or institutions in ¥/hich man must be 
fitted - the family, inhere he learns co-operation and

forbearance as portrayed by woman; the state, of which man 
must form a part if society is to be possible and humanity 
as a whole, which is a storehouse of all man has accomplished 
in the past, and of which each man must feel himself an 
integral part, that it may continue to advance. 

The political basis for man’s happiness is found in 
Comte’s Syst'hme de Politique Positive. Corresponding to the 
intellectual development of the race there has been a 
practical evolution. Iji the beginnings we find society an 
offensive militarism, which later changes to defensive 
militarism. Corresponding to the metaphysical period, we 
find here also a period of transition and of anarchy. This 
becomes ordered in industrialism. In the secular department 
of the state there is to be a just and exact division of 
labor. The capitalists who deal with the most general taeis, 
likely the bankers, are to rule. Their successors are to be 
appointed, not by the many, but by themselves* Ruling 
capitalism is to be held in Check by the morality of society, 
fostered by the priests of htaaariity, and, if neeessarj?, by 
peaceful strikes of the proletariat. On the spiritual side, 
is a theocracy of priests. Here there is no division of 
labor but all know all sciences and arts. They are to have 
little property or wealth so that motives of personal interest 
will not enter in. Hor are they to have any real control over 
practical affairs except through advice given to the rulers. 

Psychologically, Comte reconciles the Intellect to the 
heart by bringing the general principles that underlie 




29 


feelings and beliefs to light and casting away the accidents 
that surround these principles. For Comte, also, the only 
possible synthesis of knowledge is subjective. Yet this is 
not a sensational synthesis since it is mde through humanity 
as a whole. It is wholly a practical synthesis and does not 
deal at all with origins or metaphysics. 

Ethics or the science of morality is for Comte a very 
important phase of human life. In primitive man, two 
attitudes to society are found - egoistic and altruistic. 
Egoism at first greatly predominates. But due to the 
necessities of the struggle with enviroiment, and to the 
union of mankind by theology first and now by science and by 
goveamment, altruism triumphs. ¥mn lives only as he lives 
socially, so the priests teach men to live for humanity as 
a whole. 

Comte condemns theology but he loves religion. '’Comte 
defines religion as the concentration of the three altruistic 
affections - of Beverence toviards tliat which is above us. 

Love towards that which helps and sustains us, and Benevolence 
tofmrds that which needs our aid", (fhe Social Philosophy of 
Comte - Edward Caird, page IMj. Bevereiice is a submission 
to the fatality of nature* Love is towards Hmariity as the 
mediator of nature’s enmity. Beiievoleiice is the aid given 
to Humanity that it may develop yet more. Humanity is Comte’s 
GfOd. By Humanity he means the abstract conception of man as 
a social aggregate in the past, present, and future. Humanity 
is worshipped as the "Crand itre” by its priests and by all

men. The conscious poetical fictions of earth as a '*Grand 
Fetiche’^ and space as the ’’Grand Milieu” were later added 
as more or less necessary to a complete religion. Immortality 
of the individual was, for Comte, unthinkable, since it was 
a selfish concept subversive of the future of humanity. Of 
course, Comte has no real god except Humanity ivhich is but 
man as a social aggregate. 

Thus Auguste Comte may be said to have been the first 
of those who positively disbelieved in God and who at the same 
time as positively believed in and worked for man. 







cHAPa?ii:i-i V 


After Corate there followed a positivist school in 
Snglan<^^_^/hich, though it adopted Oorate's general philosophy, 
held itself aloof from his religion, This school is usually 
}aiown as Utilitarian. It dealt x^ith no ’'a priori'^ ideas hut 
bases all its doctrines on experience. Its aim a 
hedonism based on public use. 

Later a psycho-physical parallelism arose championed 
by Pechner. This tlieoi^ maintains that the psychical 
processes run alongside the physical movements, without 
exerting any influence upon them. This view, ho¥;ever, x/aa 
modified by maintaining that the physical and the psychical 
are but two ways of looking at a single ultimate reality. 

There were, further, two views regardijig this ultiraate reality. 
Some claimed it is unlike either body or mind and is therefore 
unkno?/n. Others, notably Paulsen, claimed tliat reality is 
identical with the conscious series and that all the minor 
consciousnesses in things, plants, animals, and men have 
their unity in the one great life of God. 

Evolution was first emphasized in modern tiifies by 
Darwin. By postulating the gradual development of or^nie 
forms he brought organic life under mtural lew. This 
development is based on natural selection, the survival of 
the fittest. And the eliaracterist ics of the fittest are 


31 




32 


transmitted by heredity. 

Herbert Spencer (1820*-1903) applied evolution to all 
things. By evolution, he meant the process by v/hich things 
become at once more complex and more unified. His evolution ' 
will evidently rest in equilibration and then fall into decay. 
However, a new cycle follows dissolution. Biologically "Life 
is the continuous adjustment of internal relations to external 
relations". {Spencer quoted in Durant: fhe Story of 
Philosophy, p. 402). Life cannot be, in its essence, con-- 
ceived in physico-chemical terms. Psychology is mostly 
deterministic growth, each individual being determined in a 
large measure by his biological heritage and by his instinctive 
response to new situations. Government is an organism created 
and developed to fulfil the needs of men. Government should 
interfere with the individual as little as possible since it, 
as a special organ, has only a specialized function - to 
prevent mutual aggression, iind, since, in the last analysis 
natural law is supreme and human effort cannot prevail against 
it - here, of a surety, is naturalistic deteimlnim, tilth man 
a lagging second to naturei !I?he aim of ethics Is adjustment 
to environment. Phis is attained through the discovery and 
then the application of natural law. Spencer granted the 
existence of an -absolute. But since human minds think only 
in terms of relativil^, they cannot know the Absolute. Yet, 
for religion, there is something positive; the feeling of 
awe in the presence of the mysteries of the universe. 

Neitzsche (1844-1900) worshipped at the shrine of a 
Superman, perfected in the school of strife. His Vs/hole

philOL3ophy ij a protest against a ’’slave morality which 
panders to the weak and stupid but discriminates against the 
strong and the capable. All govermient and all morality must 
be used to develop genius or the Superman. The will to power 
is basic in man and over-rides reason and morality, but it is 
at the basis of all huxoan achievement. For the mass of men 
Heitzsche did not care but only for his Superman^ which he 
first thought to create as a new species, but later only as 
an iruiividual, created by eugenics and by special training. 

To Christianity iJeit^he opposed an unequivocal atheism. 

Bergson (h. 1859) reacts against materialism and believes 
in an "elan vital". Time is the stuff of reality and possesses 
the attributes of duration and accumulation. The primary 
factor in things is an energizing principle, while in man it 
is the "sense of life". Man is not a passively adaptive 
machine but a centre of creative evolution and as such has 
consciousness, and, having consciousness, has free will. There 
is a continual warfare of matter against life. If life defeats 
matter, it is likely that immortality of the individual will 
result. God is equivalent to Life. He is finite, being 
neither omnipotent nor omniscient. God is limited by matter 
and His gro¥/th consists in the overcaming of the inertia of 
matter step by step. 

Bendetto Groce (b. 1866) ts an idealist yet he does 
not believe in metaphysics, religion or immortality. For 
him, the worship of beeuty and the life of culture are a

aubatitute for religion. And Beauty Is the mental formation 
of an image tliat catches the essence of the thing perceived. 

Bertrand i^usaell has no other Grod than mathematics. 

In such a contradictoiy v/orld he can find no true God. Yet 
he is a lover of humanity, and hence a believer in freedom 
and in education, that developes the scientific habit of mind. 
For him, the two great commandments for a new and natural 
morality are the principle of reverence for humanity and of 
tolerance for its opinions* 

Santayana (b* 1863) is a materialist and mechanist 
in philosophy and a behavioriat in psychology. a?here is no 
need to caU. nature God and an animal faith provides a 
sufficient basis for life. His ideal society would be ruled 
by a timocracy. 

William James (1842“1900| ?/as a pragmatist. His 
problems all deal x^ith man^s terrestrial career. Conscious¬ 
ness is a flux and system of relations. Yet he has a theism; 
but it is pluralistic and his God is finite, "^but one helper, 
’primus inter pares’, in the midst of all the shapers of the 
great world's fate”. (Jaraes quoted by Durant, The Story of 
Philosophy, p. 660). His universe is a multinverse, a 
battleground of cross-currents and conflicting purposes. 

John Dewey (b. 1869) believes in naturalistic 
evolution. He deals only with specific situations and has 
no place for metaphysics. He believes in social heredity. 
Heality is the flow of experience as such. Dewey eliminates 
the concept of the Absolute and bases his ethics on growth 
as a criterion, free-will, and trust in thought.

CHAPTEK Y1 

In the luldist of phlloi^ophietj such as those of Bertrand 
Russell and of Joiin Dewey, there has arisen what Poerster 
(Humanism and Americaj calls a school of American humanism* 

Its birthday, as a movement, he places in 19^8, although odd 
individuals had shown humanistic traits before that date* 

Its backgromid is a world weary of revolt and scepticism and 
turning towards a quest for standards* It has been born in 
a day when scientific materialism is no longer the ¥/orld*s 
dominant philosophy, and when the seieneas that deal with man 
himself are niaking great headway, notably the science of 
psychology* fhis school aixos to study man as man, confusing 
him neither with the natuial nor with the divine* In the 
ethical sphere, it is searching for an integration of values 
that may yet Justij^ modernity* It is opposed by obsessions 
with physical things and by instincts that bind men to the 
animal order. Yet it laoves onward; acquiring and organising 
the knov/ledge of past and present; bringing discipline to an 
undisciplined generation and urging men to develop their 
latent diversities with mature reasonableness, 

Walter Lippriann, journalist and philosopher, has caught 
the spirit of this nev; movement. He declares his disbelief in 
the ancestral order and his belief in man in a clear and

forceful style in Preface to Morals’. He studied most of 
his philosopliy at Harvard University. His chief teachers 
were William James, George Santayana and Graham Wallas. 

First, Lippmannclears away much musty debris. He 
declares in no uncertain manner that the ancestral order 
has been dissolved by the acids of modernity. Unbelief.has 
become a real oroblem. Life for many is nought else save a 
diazy whirl of irreligion and misgiving. Orthodox liberalism 
prophesied that when man should have inherited the kingdoms 
of this world all would be well. He has inherited them in his 
own undisturbed right. But all his irlieritanee has brought, 
so far, is a grudging endurance of unsanetified compulsions. 

Once man was able to Biake sorties, searching for moral guidance 
independent of external authority. But, become afraid of the 
elements, he was able to retreat into the shelter of s new 
orthodoxy. But, modernity has made it impossible to reconstruct 
an enduring orthodoxy, though the wants that orthodoxy satisfied 
remain. God, man made in his ovm image, long as man was 
ignorant of God’s true origin, popular religion throve. But 
now man knov-s this origin and the old litex^al religion of the 
masses is fast melting away. Fosdick is certain that God 
cannot be a world-king and no man is sure that He is personal. 
Indeed there have aliays been two gods; the God of the masses 
who rules a theocracy and the God of the educated minority, 
who is the sum of ideal values. Certainty is no more. Literal 
and allegorical interpretations of the Bible are both discredit¬ 
ed. Modernism has divided religion in two. ^nd the parts hang 



37 


together only because of their common renunciation of the 
world. The religion of coinraon people tells of endless life, 
of certainty and of an ecclesiastical machinery that draws 
men heavenward. But the modern philosophical religion tells 
of immortal ideas, of provisional hypotheses and of freedom 
from all ecclesiastical machinery. Man forced, by 
circumstances, to adopt the philosophical religion, no longer 
finds that his ovm purpose is a part of the purpose of the 
whole creation and for the average laan this means the end of 
religious consolation and of moral sanction. The "acids of 
modernity" have eaten away the idea that the universe is 
governed by a kingly person* Doctrines no longer fit the 
truth. Ilor are the rales of divine revelation relevant to 
modern life. Modern city civilisation, novelties, and neirs- 
papers have washed away the landmarks of popular religion* 

OrJ.y an uncertified and random collection of successful men 
and their wives rule* ^11 authority in the religious world 
has broken down. The government of human affairs is no longer 
regarded as a subordinate part of divine government. 

Toleration has become a working principle for rulers in church 
and state and few men care to accept without question the 
authority of any one sect. In education, the rivalry of sects 
has forced a comproraise of so-called non-sectarian but, in 
reality, agnostic teaching. Patriotism, too, has given to the 
state much of the devotion that once upheld the church. Many 
important provinces of life are forever lost to popular 
religion. The doctrine, that the church has authority to 
regulate business in man’s spiritual interest, has been

abaridoned. Control over the family regarding sexual life and 
regarding children has been broken by womanself-assertion 
and by the separation between love and parenthood that birth 
control makes possible, The will to produce religious 
painting has gone from the artist* Tradition is no longer, 
for him, a source of inspiration and of convent ions. Yet, he 
is not fitted to be a prophet, since there is no ine*vltabl 0 
connection between the capacity to make beautiful objects and 
the capacity to discover tx^uth. Art for art*s sake ia 
suicidal since it has no philosophy and lives only for the 
intense realization of the present moment. The artist, now 
that all the former ideals and standards have melted amy, is 
forced to carry on his shoulders the burden of originality. 
There is a new drama of destiny unfolding* tith the proven 
falsity of the "Great Scenario", which is Lippmann^s way of 
describing the Bible story, objective moral certitudes have 
gone. Miracles, that for the coimon people show truth and 
authority, have passed from religion to science. And, there 
is a deep, irreconcilable conflict between religion and 
science. Religion desires a certain kind of universe. ^Science, 
by a neutral method, explains the universe that exists. 
Theocracy, too, is poles apart from humanisrri. Theocracy 
encourages conformity to the will of God, humanism to the 
conditions that make for human happiness. 

l^ith the ancestral order in apparent dissolution, a 
choice faces us. "The choice is fundamental and exclusive, 
and it determines all the conclusions ?;hieh follow. For

obviously to one who believes that the world is a theocracy, 
the problem is how to bring the strayed and rebellious masses 
of mankind bock to their obedience, how to restore the lost 
provinces of God, the invisible King. But to one who takes 
the humanistic view the problem is how mankind, deprived of 
the great fictions, is to come to terras with the needs which 
created those fictions”., fLlppmarm: p. 143-4). Lippmann 
feels compelled to take the humanistic view. 

In men, need is due to frustrated hopes, ^nd, there 
lingers a memory?’, of no historical foundation, of a world that 
once was as we think it ought to be now. T-here are tmo tmjQ 
that man can live in the land of his heart’s desire. He can 
follow his desires to happiness, or he can desire only iirbat is 
possible. I'he insight of humanism helps rimn, at this point. 

It looks at the two approaches to life, freedom and restraint. 
It remembers that all careful thinkers have found renunciation 
to be an essesitlal part of life. Indeed, a rational ascetic 
principle will fit imn to serve an idcjal- But the principle 
"Do .'Vhat Thou Wilt” leads to the rule of the passions. In 
history, there has been an oscillation between absolute 
asceticism and absolute freedom, since either alone is impos* 
sible. Morality, as the separation of good and evil impulses, 
is impossible. For, good and evil are not objective qualities 
but the relationships of variable desires and variable objects 
of desire. The goal of humanism is the development of a 
helpless infancy into a self-governing maturity. The child 
assumes that the world is in gear with his ovua appetites. But, 
by the breaking up and by the reconstructing of habits, the

adult must come to expect what the world can give. The 
function of high religion (by this, Lippmann means true 
religion) is to reveal to men the quality of mature experience 
and to help them to arrive at that experience. The ^^High 
Religion’’ of the modern world was the religion of the great 
teachers always. Their religion has dealt not with theocracy, 
but with the internal life of man. There has been Inherent 
in the religion of the "great teachers" an aristocratic 
principle. For, no teacher has yet been wise enough to teach 
his wisdom to ell mankind. But the modern situation is 
peculiar. The old coercive religion is no longer possible. 

So, man must make radical and original adjustments. Hereto¬ 
fore, the coMaon men has regarded high religion as separate 
from his main concernsi lov?, the insight into the value of 
disinterestedness, vdiich high religion gives, is the only- 
clue to a solution of modern perplexities. 

The "genius of modernity" is found in the application 
of the conclusions of maturity, in'all its disintereatednees 
and detachment, to the. affairs of life. With regard to the 
cure of the soul, evil must be conquered or accepted, l/ian 
must no longer look on life superstitiously, regarding evils 
as signs and portents of the whole of human destiny. Rather 
man must think of evil as an inv;ard condition of his soul. 

He must be self-conscious and face reality with detacliment, 
understanding, and disinterestedness. Yirtue consists of the 
ability to respond to 3,arger situations. Its source is 
ijiaturity and its chief quality la disinterestedness. Yirtue 
is to be put into practice by means of a very inclusive

education, which will teach men to see the inevitable place 
of disinterestedness in the world. 

Modem business is based on the ’’invention of 
invention”. Its creative principle is science. And, pure 
science is high religion incarnate. Business, not long ago, 
was ruled by the acquisitive instincts of the employing 
capitalist. Yet this rule was fallacious, since each man does 
not know his own interest, and since it created no social 
order. Old style refom, however, was equally fallacious. 

For, government policing or control of business gave no 
guarantee of disinterestedness. The only sure v^ay to procure 
disinterestedness is through the refining of character. To-day, 
business by its very bigness has diffused the acquisitive 
instinct. Industry has been forced to create methods of self- 
control and in the business man the discipline of objective 
information has engendered disinterestedness. Ideals, for 
business and all else, have come to be imaginative understand¬ 
ings of what is desirable in what is possible. 

Modern government should be based on the loyalty of the 
citizen, who loves his country and, if he seeks to change the 
status quo, vfill do so without violence and with due regard for 
his fellovz-citizens. The highest loyalty has evolved from 
loyalty to a human or divine personality, through loyalty 
to a corporate personality, to loyalty to a pattern of conduct. 
There is, to-day, a pluralism of loyalties, because of the 
diversification of men’s interests. Men are now willing to 
’’live and let live”. 


True government resides in the people

based on a multitude of decisions made daily by millions, Tbe 
duty of the statesman is to re-educate towards detachment and 
disinterestedness and to make enduring adjustments for the 
good of humanity. 

Love in the "Great Society" is a deep problem. Sexual 
conduct, because of the decay of chaperonage and because of 
the discovery of contraceptive methods, has beoorae a matter 
not of public but of private regulation, fho logic of birth-- 
control leads to the separation of love as an art from 
parenthood as a vocation. Some hold that love consists only 
of sexual ecstasy. While others hold that it ie the "dealring 
of whole worlds" together. Convent ion may help us to decide 
Y/hether this separation is in hamai^y ?/ith himian iiappineas. 
For, it is its fimction to declare the mesnlBg of experience. 
The new hedonism, founded under the best possible conditionB, 
has found only "the wasteland". The tranBeendentalista, in 
love, who v/ould desire whole worlds together, turn their 
thoughts only to impractical things. 1 better basis, on which 
to discuss this separation, would be the logic of nature* It 
says that the hman personality is a unit and carmot be 
divided. True marrisge is not a romantic escapade but a life¬ 
long partnership* Gompatibility is a proeeas and ean be 
achieved through harmo23y and disinterestedness, jand, as long 
as marriage is the dominant insight into the reality of love 
and happiness it will survive, but once it ceases to be that 
it will be no longer neeessar^j'.

three steps to take. First, he declares his ideals, baaed 
on an interpretation of huraan needs and on good as the coiirse 
vitality v/onld choose if it were clearly imderstood- Second, 
he ixnist choose a way. He mxist choose either the religion of 
theocracy or that of insight into a matured personality. And 
his GrOd must be either Ood the king or Sod the highest good. 

God, indeed, is the supreme prineipls in \¥hich man expresses 
his destijiy. Lastly, he espouses the religion of the spirit. 
This is a qualitative religion of mature understandings 
tolerance, and imperturbability, which is Inherently profitable. 

Surely, Lippmarm’s philosophy uses modern methods and is 
oriented to modern needs. lie is somewhat of a Stoic. Ibr, he 
believes in a modified ^apatheia’. He is an individualist, 
though he believes in an individualism of reformed individuals. 
He doss not believe in orthodox religion* Only ideas ar© 
iiffiTxortal. Man*s will is limited only by'natural law. God is 
merely a symbol. Yet he has a cogent way out of the presaiit 
muddle,- the sclentifls method in hands of mtare individuals. 

He believe's in man at his highest. He has ilttl© patience with

CHAPTiiiH VII 


Max Carl Otto ia a second modem humanistic 
philosopher who does not believe that God exists« Otto has 
been a professor of philosophy for twenty years at the 
University of Wisconsin. He is a well~kno\?n public figure, 
having made many appearances before both scientific and 
educational bodies. He is, at the same time, an ”anti- 
theist'’ and a lay-preacher. 

He holds an "affirmative faith in the non-existence 
of God". He finds many grounds for his non-belief in God. 

Historically, he finds that theistie faith is 
yoxmger than man. And that mm invented the gods for the 
purpose of explaining his environment. Religion has been 
forced to re-define God again and again to make its belief 
in God intellectual end acceptable to science, fhs trend 
of this recurrent re-definition has been to withdraw God 
from evei^-day things, and to enlarge the sphere of self- 
dependent action at the expense of God-dependent action. 

As a result, the modern mind has shifted its hopes from 
rationalistic theology to naturalistic science as an 
interpreter of the world. In a sane future, the nontheistie 
principle ¥#ill be extended to areas where divine guidance is 
still relied upon.

Certainly there is no evidence that some It is 
present in the process of man's biological origin and 
evolution. 

llor can we argue from progress to the existence of 
God. For, we cannot be certain that man is moving forward. 
The development of the individual is due not to one but to 
many forces, both inner and outer. And, in ai^ case, our 
judgment must be partial since all we see of life is only 
a peep into a great and long drama. 

Otto’s philosophy is definite* Absolutes are out of 
range of the human mind. Yet, we can see enough of reality 
to question the existence of God. Unity is an unnecessary 
dogma. For, the only unity that nature can Icnow is such as 
comes from the interaction of the collection of inter¬ 
operative forces of which nature is coiaposed. Authentic 
search for truth must begin, not from general l^potheses, 
but from particular situations. Thus, we find that man’s 
search for the good life is the origin of his God-concept. 
Otto maintains finally that his belief in God’s non- 
^slstenee outruns demonstration. 

In theology, divine purpose is not. Since, evolution 
has been often bungling and wasteful and has not moved 
towards one far-off divine event. History of rewards to the 
wicked and neglect of the righteous, as well as the fact of 
war disprove the existence of a power for good. Theism is 
not able to solve the problem of evil, since it must either 
call back the Devil or enthrone Chance to do so. Saddest of 




46 


all, theism allows the rule of science in practical life 
even to the exclusion of religion. But, in the evaluation 
of life, religion alone is allowed to act, Thus it sets up 
a dualism Between life in practice and life in theoi*y. 

Otto *3 personal experience has led him to the 
conclusion that, for him, life is more worth-^while \?ithout 
Grod. Experience, too, sho\?s that the source of devotion is 
not one thing, God, hut is things,- an ideal, 

patriotism, love for one^s fellow-men^ Indeed, the non- 
theistic principle has passed the pragmatic test. For, its 
use has resulted in the enhancement of hman welfare. Man, 
in the past, turning to God for help, had neglected the full 
investment of his ovm powers. Indeed, he had Jeopardised 
his life hy losing faith in himself. 

On the positive side of his religion, Otto huilda on 
the sufficiency of man, has nowhere else to turn for 

help hut to himself and to social and natural envlroimeBt, 
Yet, here, he may find unsuspected resources, Man’s 
evolution, despite its hungling, tee, especially In its 
last stages, been a process of indescrihahle grandeur. 

A ’’God-less' good life'' is both possible and necessaiy. 
Its basis is a faith in human intelligence, in natural 
desires and in ethical will. It Is the assumption of human 
responsibility for human destiny in the best Interests of 
humanity. It is, in other words, the quest tor a satisfying 
and meaningful life. Hiuaan ?/ill is the motive-power. It is 
the drive of desire that is the engine of living, and not

the gods. There is an inherent hunger in human beings 
which drives them to an active and resolute search for a 
better manner of living. And, the only source of ideals is 
natural desire. For exan^le, men of the right temper or 
quality face death undismayed. Greece and China have been 
nontheistie, yet have contributed much of the world’s 
cultural wealth. Modern Russia has I’id herself of God, yet 
she has now a more signigicant spiritual life than any other 
European nation* The way of progress is to be found by 
applying the nontheistie principle to the art of life. But, 
in so doing, we must not dei^ buslnesa nor seeh a life of 
power for its own sake* And, alllions must no longer m now 
be forced to work at tasks devoid of spiritual quality* 
Science is valuable as the basis of a diaaipllBed intelli¬ 
gence, but \m must not thoughtleESly capitulate to it. 

.-lather, should things and ideals be re^rded as eo-eqml 
aspects of esperlential reality, and, as such, be kept 
happily inter-related* Spiritual greatness must be based, 
on faith in laan* Iven if there were a God he would like man 
to trust himself. Inspiration and guidance to elevate the 
level of human interests must come out of inner himan 
resources. There are many attitudes bo life which can bring 
spiritual refreslment without the drawbacks of transcendent¬ 
alism. There is the feeling of oneness ?#ith all life,- with 
our kind and with the friendly, all-sustaiiiing earth. There 
is a recognition of the spell of B^stery in each other. In 
life, and in the co^os* Althou^, we must never be mystical.

a sense of mystery will benefit our character by acknowledg¬ 
ing ignorance. We should joy in responsibility. We should 
recognize evil and seek to eliminate or to circumvent it. 

Thus Otto concludes his series of articles in the 
Christian Century, (Aug. 10, 1932, p. 980): "Complete and 
abiding satisfaction and unclouded assurance of life’s 
significance are unattainable. But great achievement is 
possible. Humanism, adopted as a way of life, gives 
substance to idealism, adds worth to labor, business, and 
the professions, brings dignity to the public service and 
opens for everyone a promising way to sanctity, richness, 
and joy in living." 

So, Otto has no place for Ood, even as a symbol, nor 
for metaphysics; but only for man and the practical affairs 
of life. 



CHilPTim VIII 


Probably the ablest contemporary nontheistic 
religionist is A. Eustace Haydon« Haydon was, for some 
years, a Baptist minister in Canada« More recently, he 
has been appointed to the Chair of OomparatlYe Beligion in 
the University of Chicago. In the university, let it be 
remarked, and not in the fheological Aemiimry of the 
Baptist church, which is on the Chicago c^pus* 

Of Haydon’s book, Ihe Quest of the Ages, f . V* Smith, 
professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, says: 
"(This book is a brave and heroic gesture for an age that 
needs it much. In style, the book la a veritable pros@=” 
poea from beginning to end*d» And, the publlsherB, I^rper 
and Brothers, aayi ^^Presents the indispensable background 
for an understanding of the drift of modern religion and the 
materials necessary to an appreciation of the rise of a new 
humanism in the modern warld.d^ 

In his preface, Haydon clearly and boldly defines 
religion as ’’a shared quest of the good life ’, (p. ixh It 
cannot be separated from its rooting in the social life of 
man. Indeed, all religions liave been the laanifold ?/ays that 
horaan life has sought to mould a cosmic process to the 
service of raan^s ideal. 


49

The ”quest" is as old as man himself. In the early 
days, it aimed simply to live. Yet, at no time, was there 
any mystery in religion. For, religion is a practical and 
prescribed way of behavior. Men sought protection and 
found helpers in the gods, who were the powers of the 
environing natural world. As they gained practical teovv- 
ledge they combined it with their magical-social ceremonial. 
Vvith culture, men desired not only to live but to live 
joyously. The inherent defect in the quest has been lack 
of laiowledge to clarify and to give embodiment to it. 
Therefore, it has met with frustration and its realisation 
has been postponed either to a future age or to a realm, 
beyond the i^tes of death. In time, the gods became 
invisible and pregnant v/ith the unfulfilled wishes of 
mankind. Today, the quest is still hesitant. Religion is 
still given a narrow meaning* Religion, as supernaturalism, 
is not oriented to the life process. And, the endless 
complexity of modern civilization bewilders. Yet an ide^al 
is needed as against mere material mastery. And man is 
well-equipped to search for that ideal ?/ith the scientific 
method, material wealth, the social sciences, machines and 
culture, 

lilarly man iEiagined the origin of the universe in 
patterns of his own activity. All religions posit something 
without a beginning usually either a god or a universe. But, 
the essential thing is that the universe be accepted. 

Absolute Idealism accepts spirit as reality and posits a

unlveri 3 al soul. IJaturalism finds that the cosmic order 
flowers in man. Determinism accepts the decrees of fate 
as inevitable. Theism finds the will of God to be the 
causal factor. It is not unlikely that the ultimate origin 
of the universe is an insoluble problem. Yet, we do know 
that there is a purposive drive of organisms in relation to 
their environment; that the planet has come to consciousness 
of itself in man; and that it is, through man, still in the 
throes of creation. 

Human nature, for some religions, belongs to a realm 
of reality apart from the natural world. iMle, for others, 
it is centred in the life of this world. Most religions 
have created a dualissa of soul and body. Modern insight 
into human nature has, however, revealed that no form of a 
metaphysical soul is sufficient to explain the imity of mind 
and body. Human nature is the past, biological and social, 
with capacities for a new creation. All Hiankind originates 
in a common root, is plastic, and possesses intelligence. 

For primitive'man, the gods were those simple nature 
powers of his environment, which were most ii^ortant for the 
life of the group. At first, his was a simple emotional 
response and he dealt with the gods as with human beings. 
Later, he added the concept of soul to his raental baggage 
and god-ideas became complex. The biography of the gods is 
sirf^ly the social experience of the people. In time, gods 
came to have cosmic scope. These gods were of three kinds: 
personal; super-personal, who harmonized the demands of

thought with religious values; and impersonal, which 
embodied the rule of law. In the days of iretaphysica, a 
few people found comfort in ultimates as such. Yet, most 
men still treated the ultimates as personal gods. In time, 
the defects of the gods were challenged. But later the 
real existence of the gods was denied. And, it is true 
that gods have never existed as reality. Rather, Ood-ideas 
as social creations have existed in the human mind, 1‘he 
gods of old have passed slowly a?/ay. Only for the west and 
for modem, times^ has there been any intellectual anxiety 
regarding God’s nature. Christisnity’a ladders, that led 
up to a transcendent God, have been removed, one by one, 

I’he revelation authority of the Church was removed by the 
Reformation; the authority of miracles, by eighteenth 
century rationalism; natural religion, by the study of the 
history of religions; reason, by Humes’s seeptieism; human 
exiierienee, by the history of morality; the of 

Christ, by the logic that there is no proof that God is as 
Jesus was; mystical e^erience, by the proof that it 
originates in man’s social environment, A change has come 
over marx’s mind. He has had a nem vision of the world and. 
of life’s development. His mind lias been enlarged. He has 
realized the danger of drift in modern civilization. First, 
by Absolute Idealism he made God iimnanent, Then, perplexed 
by the problati. of evil, he mde Him finite. And, now, he 
has made Him functional, merely the means to an end. Modem 
man must search the universe for support for his moral ideals. 







53 


He finds a stable balance of the natural world, both in man 
and in man’s environment. He finds that man has a secure 
biological heritage. He finds an enfolding social environment, 
fraught with the promise of an organized human society that 
will give to all an equal opportunity and that will master 
evil. The term, ’^God”, as meaning a unified cosmic support 
and leadership belongs to the distant future. The term in 
its old-fashioned sense, may, perhaps, still be used merely 
as a mediation between the old order and the new. 

For early man, evil was not a source of fear but 
simply a disagreeable fact. The interpretation of evil vms 
according to one^s opinion concerning life’s final goal and 
concerning the nature of cosmic control. Theism cannot 
solve the problem of evil and remin theism. With Absolutes, 
evil becomes relative. In nontheistic systems, it is 
attributed to suffering, illusion, or disobedience to the 
oo^ie order. Today, however, the sclentifle method opens 
the way to the mastery of evil. In natural evil, mortality 
and the planet’s destructive forces soct almost irreducible. 
But, against disease, scientific technique can do much. 

Social or moral evil comes from maladjustment, which is 
caused by conflicts of desires and by the faulty orientation 
of individuals in society. Today, evil no longer has any¬ 
thing ultimte about it, and both evils promise to yield to 
larger knowledge directed by good will. 

Three factors shape man’s religious ideal; the demand 
for satisfactions, the fact of evil and the fact of failure.

Primitive man aought satiafaction of the fundaiaental nee.da

ideal, to vjhich spiritual values, in time, are added. Others 
have projected their ideal to heavenly realms. i\lv;ays, the 
controlling world-view of an age has been reflected in its 
religious ideal. And, the good life has been guaranteed in 
the ultimate nature of the universe, fhe modern world fiz-ds 
its guarantee in the worth of men. foday, the good life can 
be based on: a secure at-homeness in the world, the Joy of 
personality, the joy of human comradeship and the joy of 
creation. These would be mere prolongations of beginnings 
that exist. 

Pomer sources of religious authority were: divination; 
astrology; revelation; inspired men or prophets with miracles 
as credentials; sacrad aoriptures; Interpreters, although their 
interpretations capie from the knowledge and x>^oblems of the 
social situation; and, mystical experience, which is, in truth, 
social wisdom suffused with emotion, who have lost the

scientific method 1 b religioiio This is a deliberative and 
objective way of thinking, ii^hich makes for change, tolerance, 
accurate analysis and happy huniaii adjuatments, 

Heiigion needs a practical x>rogram to embodj?- its ideals. 
Theology and religious iiiEtitutions must be shoved aside and 
our problems solved piecemeal. Man has, before now. Imposed 
his will on the course of events. All religions are adrift, 
looking for a savior. A new instrument, the method of science.

is at hand, Pre-scientific techiiiq^ue consisted of a dualism 
of secular and sacred; of institutions betveen them; of 
rituals that comforted in the crises of life; and, of great 
persons that were the symbols of religion. Today, factual 
knowledge and the problems of the age await us. vie need many 
programs to cover all spheres of life. A scientific 
"practicalism” must reshape factual situations and develop 
individuals through education. Spiritual leadership should 
come fi^orri the organized forces of religion, and from the most 
brilliant intellects. Man faces a great task. "We ai’e 
witnessing either the crumbling of civilization under the 
weight of its material mechanism, or the birth of a nev/ world 
organization with a spiritual ideal", (p. 332]. 

Indeed, Haydon has done much in his book. He has based 
a practical and constructive religion on the scientific method 
and on the results of the historical and comparative study of 
religions* He has recognized obvious facts that too often have 
been slurred over in the interests of religious propaganda. 

The universe, he admits, is often hostile to man. Morality 
has its origin In the social experience of the race. His 
definition of religion, as "the quest of a good life”, and as 
"a practical and prescribed way of behavior", {p. 2], is most 
inclusive* And, his conception of religion as functional is 
emancipating and has more than a semblance of truth.

Kontheistle humanism ia, in its essence, no new thing. 
For it was the attitude of many a scientist, philosopher and 
moralist in classical times. How, ho?/ever, because of the 
unrest i^llowing the Great War, and beeause of man’s recent 
scientific discoveries and mechanical inventions, it ia the 
vogue in certain climes and classes. The country, v;hich ia 
most friendly to this development, is the United states. For, 
here is the home of Haydon, Lippmann, Otto, Sellars, Dreiser 
and many others of this school. 

Heretofore, in ?/orld history, himianism has led to 
scientific and cultural advance* In Greece, humanism was the 
milieu in which the best philosophy, poetry and science came 
to light. It was in the midst of a re-found classical 
humanism, that the Henaissanee arose. The modem situation, 
however, is different from the classical or the Renaissance. 
Humanism has followed an era of crass mechanical materialism. 
Modem humanism is moving the stress from things and machines 
to men and ideals, llontlieistic humanism is that humanism, 
which milages without theism, and, because of its denial of 
theism, claims to be most human* 

There are, indeed, many merits in a frank nontheiatic 
humanism. Its noble, inspiring and idealistic view of man

and his destiny la best epitomized in Kaydon’s words: "Iv'ian 
was a late comer on the stage. V/hen he first emerged through 
the dawn shadows with wonder in his eyes, he had climbed to 
his high status upon the hard-earned experience of innumerable 
living forms. Heir of the ages, he began his long march 
toward mastery of the planet”, (Quest of the Ages, p. 1). It 
is indeed a noble and an awe-inspiring sight to see man facing 
fearlessly and alone the forces of a universe and the problems 
of his destiny, 

fhe attitude of this nontheistic school is above 
reproach. It shows a syiapathy that even Christianity has very 
seldom achieved. Here is no stem denunciation of opponents 
as pervert era of the truth. Humanism thinks that the historic 
religions have iinpeded the progress of mankind as well as 
harmed its character. Yet, it Is more than kind to these 
criminals. It is at great pains to understand the origin, 
growth and function of these religions. ITor, does it ask man 
to give thm up suddenly. i;^ther^ it provides for a transi- 
tioiial stage, when man can use the old term, ”God”, until he 
is strong enou^ to breathe the bracing nontheistic air. i^nd, 
kindest deed of all, it offers to the leaders of existing 
organised religion the positions of leadership araong the 
forces that are to regenerate society. A cheery optimism 
pervades its writings.^ It believes in the world as it is. 

For, the beginnings of in^rovements are already here. And, 
it is sure that, ultimately, man will v;in the victory. For, 
he has mastered the world for only selfish purposes before.

He has the scientific method. i\nd, idealism is not yet dead. 
Unlike Lot’s wife it looks ever forward and never backward. 

The future is fraught with possibilities and man is far from 
vile. Existing religions seek satisfactions,- each in its 
own petty way. But^ in its quest, nontheistic humanism uses 
the wisdom of past and present; of East and West; of religion 
and irreligion; of sacred and secular. 0?he historic religions 
have often neglected whole fields of human life. The ’’non- 
theist” makes the whole of life his province,- business, sex, 
government, ethics, art, religion. 

Its methods are most authentic. It uses, first, the 
scientific method, and fears not to apply it to all loiowledge 
and to all action. For, it accepts gladly all the findings 
of science* It is ever sincere, free from prejudice and 
disinterested. History is used as a background in the study 
both of man and of his religions. Moreover, these humanists 
have true histarical iioagination,- that quality of living the 
past over again. Psychology is, used to explain man as a 
biological and a,social being, and to advocate the just use 
of his intellect, emotion and wi3-l. And, the fad of 
behaviorism has not been Indulged in. Sociology has been 
recognised as an invaluable science. For, from Comte onward, 
all the of this school have been certain that life 

and religion must be social if they are to be at all. The 
centre of interest is not some future or past age, nor is it 
a dream-realm in the clouds. Rather, it is this world in 
which we live. All man’s energies are to be exerted here and

understand his natui'al and his social environment and leam

self and his fellov;s, can conquer nature where it is

The first and last article of the nontheistic creed is, ”I

the universe has risen to consciousness and by him its very 
shape can be altered; its rivers can be, turned aside; its dry

society is clearly recogni25ed. It is not an authority 
cortmianding from dinai or pulpit. But it is an interi^reter 
of human experience. Man is disciplined by his environment 
and not by antiquarian teachi^igs. He learns from frustration 
and from the past experience of the race, to desire only what 
the world can give. Altruism is stressed as never before. 

Man strives neither for selfish personal salvation, nor for 
a selfish personal immortality; but for the good of all raen. 
War is abhorrent. ’Shat it Biay cease, men must realize that 
they are all brothers. Millions must no longer be eir^loyed 
at menial and unspiritual tasks. 

Its philosophieel motto might ¥;ell be ’^Quaecmaque 
Vera". ,It has no desire to break the sacred idols of mankind. 
But, if to find the truth for a bravely questing humanity it 
must, it will. Beason is enthroned. And, faith must believe 
only things that have been proven. Its healthy naturalism 
accounts for primitive man^s religion^ as the worship of 
girrml e nature powers. And^ man as nature greatest child 
can feel more thoroughly at home in the universe than he has 
•ever felt before. It is realistic, baaed on facts and seen 
things. Yet, it has a lofty and a moral idealism. 5’or it, 

Eian should seek not only material things but such spiritual 
qualities as the joy of comradeship and the joy of creation 
for his fellows* 

In religion, it has abolished theology. In doing so, 
it has cleared out much theological rubbish, which it is to 
be hoped will never return,- crass anthropomorphism, verbally 
inspired Scriptures, infallible moral codes, supernatural

rovGlation, It shov'a, rather concluaively, that apiritual 
values are hased on a score of other things besides Ood. The 
social roots of religion are plainly shown, ^nd, there is no 
doubt that eii^hasis on religion as social experience is much 
needed in many quarters. It rightly emphasizes the pragmatic 
in religion, making man and his good life the goal, and 
religious institutions the means. Here, one can, at least, be 
free from the fear that the church may ask the sacrifice of 
one’s soul to save its precious machinery, iiivll, it 
approaches in the only decent way as nothing ultimate but as 
something with which men can grapple and win the victory. It 
dispels, one would like to hope forever, those frightful and 
fantastic nightmares of determinism and original sin. 

Unlike much atheism, agnosticism and orthodox religion, 
it has a real social program, its program is practical. 

Theory is to be the basis of practical endeavor and not the 
stuff that dreams are made of. Indeed all its proposed 
reforms have their beginnings in the present world. It has a 
sanely constructive program. Individuals are to be educated. 
Situations are to be adjusted so that all men may live happy 
lives. It proposes a democracy safe for the world. Laws are 
to be formed from multitudes of little decisions made daily 
by millions of men. Power is to be exerted by the interaction 
of men and not by force, itiid the machinery of law is to 
become sensible and to try to enforce only those laws in v/hich 
the majority of the citizens believe.

Indeed, nontheistic humanism has strong bases in 
history and in science* It has a fine ethic, a practical 
program, a new and unencumbered religion* And, it puts the 
stress where it should be put,- on man in a this-world 
environment with a this-worldly social ideal. 









PART IV 


CHAPTER X 

F. H, Barry, who is an avowed opponent of nontheistic 
humanism, bears v/itnesa to its influence: "It is no doubt a 
fundamental error; but it is the creed of some 50 per cent 
of the more seriously minded modems" (The Relevance of 
Christianity, p* 135), 

Barry also puts forv/ard a pertinent question regard¬ 
ing the permanence of this humanism as a living force, "The 
question is whether whatever is true and vital in the 
Humanism of the twentieth century can survive the subsidence 
of its Christian bases," (p. 110). 

Truly, nontheistic humanism has much in its favor. 

But, it has, in the eyes of mny, a few grave defects. 

With regard to the past, it rejects many fundamental 
religious dogmas that have been held for centuries. ITow, 
these dogmas have, admittedly, a great deal of untruth as 
they are most commonly stated. Yet, millions have believed 
in them over long centuries and, often, with very satisfying 
results. Therefore, they merit, it would seem, at least, a 
more thorough analysis and test than these humanistic writers 
have given th^. A faith, that conquered all the rival 
interests of a decadent Homan Empire; that ruled a continent

both spiritually and temporally for over 700 years; that has 
led men to give up riches, family, fame tind life itself,- 
should this be so summarily set aside? It may be all 
illusion. But, surely, a more thorough proof from history 
and from experience should be necessary to convince men 
that it is altogether illusory, a dream of the dark night 
of superstition that fades away with science*s clear and 
radiant dawn* 

fhis movement is almost exclusively intellectual. 
Room, but not much, is left for emotion and will. Its 
whole basis is an intellectual evaluation of the past; a 
scientific analysis of all phases of life in the present; 
and a perfect program for the future, intellectually 
conceived, to be intellectually applied. Here is no food 
for babes in the faith. There is no milk that the multitude 
can drink while their leaders digest strong meat. There are 
no simple rules, no plain bits of advice for those who have 
not yet the power, unaided, to work out their salvation from 
the results of a scientific analysis of morals and of 
religion. Barry is of the opinion that Lippmann exaggerates 
the effect of the intellectual solvents of religion. For, 
not unreasonably, ^rry insists that the masses still desire 
not only emotion but also moral effectiveness in their 
religion. This intellectualism is not a new fault of 
humanism. Stoicism and Boaitivism were intellectual creeds 
and they never penetrated belo?/ the intellectuals to the

’’folk”. Nor have we yet heard of a hiananiat church with 
large congregations and v/ith many good works to its credit. 

Nletaphysics is scorned by the humanist. For him, 
ultimate origins are of no significance. The practical 
affairs of life are so vital that to spend time on 
metaphysical speculation is to be criminally negligent. 3o, 
he has no theory regarding the ultimate origin of universe 
or of man. He deals only with scientific hypotheses 
practically applied to the practical life of the present. 
Undoubtedly this attitude leads to a tendency to regard 
process in time as the only reality there is. Ignorant of 
the ultimate origin of the universe, the humanist lacks 
confidence in its rightness. Yet there is much against such 
a view. Had one or two conditions been altered the orderly 
development of life on this planet would have been prevented. 
Surely such careful development can be better explained by 
a Purpose tiian by chance. Some biologists claim to find at 
each stage in the evolution of life, a new emergent, vhich 
does not come from the preceding organism but seems to enter 
from without. May not this be a Purpose striving to express 
Itself? Baillie, in his inaugural address at Union 
Theological Seminary, said, "Yet in our hearts ?/e all deeply 
know that every one of these pursuits presupposes some kind 
of supporting faith and that, if such faith were entirely 
taken away from us, they would all droop and die,- as it were 
of heart-failure”, (Alumni Bulletin, Vol. YI, No. 1 - p. 7). 
The hmnanist claims that nature is absolutely neutral yet 
history is full of bitter examples of the retributive

consequences that naturally have followed evil. 

Indeed there is, in humanism, no Mind or Purpose 
behind man. Man’s mind springs, as it were, miraculously, 
from a non-mental chaos by the process of chance. A dualism 
is created by a naturalistic metaphysics. For, by it, an 
indifferent cosmic order is opposed to an ethical humanistic 
society. Here are no eternal values. Ilor, have values any 
basis save In man’s past and present. ^Ihe effect of such a 
theory, sometimes, is to leave man homeless and disillusioned. 
Barry speaks of ’’the confusion of the world, outv/ardly secure 
and self-indulgent, inwardly blinded by doubt and self- 
distrust”, (p. 131). Krutch, one who has imbibed deeply of 
the waters of humanism, laments that mankind’s is a lost 
cause and that there is no place for us in the universe, -and, 
many modern men have come to distrust life itself. Masefield 
wrote in fhe Vfidow in the Bye Street, ’’Life’s a long headache 
in a noisy street”, (quoted by Foerster, p. V). Too often, 
as in eighteenth century romanticism, man’s faith in man 
degenerates to a belief in the natural and not the spiritual 
part of him and fast descends to a pure naturalism. 

Hor, does there seem to be an adequate moral and 
spiritual dynamic. Rather the humanist seems to have shut 
himself off from real moral motive power. Science, whose 
importance he probably exaggerates, offers in its laws and 
methods neither motive power nor abiding principles of 
conduct. In truth, the humanist’s only ideal seems to be 
man as he should become. Many men have insisted that an

ethical norm cannot be found in man. Rather, the highest 
moral attitude seems to clash with the making of man the 
crown of creators as well as of creation. For, men are 
often miserable offenders, llor can the standard be set by 
human society. lillse, it would be under no obligation to 
have moral ends and might then wreak great havoc, i-lather, 
it, too, should be under an ultimate obligation. 3o, the 
truest norm, in the opinion of many, is to be found in an 
outside power or purpose. Thus, man is influenced in his 
ethical life by the necessities laid on him by the universal 
system of things in v/hich he has his little part to play. 

Maybe, ethical achievement does not originate in us but in 
the demand of reality upon us. Possibly, all ethical triumphs 
are due to the influence of a Someone outside upon human lives. 
And, maybe, in teiaptation one part of man^s nature does not 
struggle against another part but the natural that is in him 
trying to push him downward to dwell among the beasts 
struggles against the supernature’, that is trying to pull 
him upward into the spiritual realm. vVhere indeed is there 
a dynamic faith in humanism that v^ould force men to be up 
and doing? God has been for generations the centre of ethi¬ 
cal and religious life. He has been the real object of 
religion and the guarantor of the religious quest. Instead 
of God, humanism offers, as an object of worship, at most, 
the personification of a life force, which is purely 
subjective, has no personality and cannot respond to man’s 
devotion. Man does seem to have an indestructible faith in

something above him. Gautama taught that gods were useless, 
and a long line of Buddhist followers deified him. So, if 
nontheistic humanism continues as a religion, might not one 
of our now-living humanists, even as Gautama, be deified? 

'*By their fruits, ye shall know them", were the words 
of Jesus. But, nontheistic humanism as a religion in the 
past had no fruits. Hor, has it yet shown any today, 
neither Stoics nor Positivists have sent active missionaries; 
founded hospitals; rescued fallen humanity; or established 
hostels for the poor. Often man fast loses faith in himself 
when humanism is extensively tried, ^he recent "de-bunking" 
fashion in American biography is, probably, a striking proof 
of this. A this-world reference life has, often, eventually 
engendered the poisons of degeneracy, fhe closing days of 
eighteenth century romanticism were, indeed, pitiful. 

tEhus there are large lacunae in nontheistic humanism, 
tradition, emotion, will, metaphysics, moral motivation, and 
worship seem to have little'or no more place. Furthermore, 
it has not yet shown.works meet for acceptance.

PART V 


CHAPTER XI 

William Peter King in his Foreward to Humanism: 
Another Battle Line says: is evident that we are 

justified in affirming with certainty that Humanism in its 
nontheistic form is not an evanescent issue. 

The nontheistic humanism of the past has been 
reviewed, and its greatest contemporary advocates have been 
studied. Outstanding merits have been discovered in their 
position, but also grave defects. 

King’s attitude of hostility towards nontheistic 
humanism is both unfortunate and unwise. Here is no battle¬ 
ground. But here is another noble company of men come to 
place their contribution upon the altar of religion. Let 
us now praise these famous men; a brave slave, Epictetus; 
a fearless philosopher-emperor, Marcus Aurelius; a hardy 
pioneer in sociology, Auguste Comte; a fearless and 
sys 5 )athetic moralist, Walter Lippmm; a daring philosopher. 
Max Carl Otto and an original religious thinker, Eustace 
Hay don. 

Would nontheistic humanism be able to stand alone 
as the religion of the world? A voice of denial is heard

from out the past. Stoicism and Positivism are noble theories, 
but they are not religions. The present movement has 
influenced many and may long continue to do so. But whether 
it will become mankind’s one religion in the future is 
another question. One cannot silence a conjecture,- that 
like its ancestors. Stoicism and Positivism, it will settle 
down as a noble theory that has lacked the depth to become 
a religion that might comfort and uplift the masses.
