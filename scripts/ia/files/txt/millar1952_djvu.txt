INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM 


Psychiatric clinicians have long recognised the importance of 
developing instruments to assess the personality structure of the 
individual. It was with this in mind that Henry Murray developed the 
Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) in 1935 for use with children and 
adults of both sexes. (32) Although the test found considerable 
success with adults and probably ranks second only to the Rorschach 
in clinical use, those working with children have become dissatisfied 
with the TAT in this respect becaus^it is structured on the adult 
level of emotional experience. (9# 11# 12, 24 , 38) 

To meet the need for a new instrument, Beliak, in 1949# 
developed the Children’s Apperception Test (CAT) for use with children 
in the three to eleven age group. (9) To date very little has been 
published on the clinical usefulness of this test. 

Scoring and interpretation of tests of apperception like the TAT 
and CAT have in the past relied mostly on the judgment and experience 
of the individual clinician. However, more recently, there has been 
an increasing emphasis on the value of normative material which has 
been statistically validated. (18, 24, 28, 33# 34# 35# 37) Normative 
material presupposes a frequency of occurrence of common elements in 
the protocols, the "elements” being any picture detail, event or idea 
composing the story. Thus, the clinician, in interpreting a protocol 
with reference to normative data# can ascertain from the subject’s 
responses the degree to which the subject conforms to group modes of

behavior* 

There is a growing appreciation that only after one has 
statistical information as to what is common can on© make an 
accurate interpretation* Most clinicians are far too easily dis¬ 
posed to interpret on the basis of their own preconceived ideas of 
what elements in the stories are significant and what are not* 
Furthermore, norms acquaint the clinician with the type of material 
that may be obtained on the test* If time is a factor, or if only 
specific areas are to be explored, selection of cards can b© based 
on normative material* 

With a firm realization of this, the present study was under¬ 
taken to provide normative data for nursery school children on the 
CAT. The approach was to analyze stories for the frequency of 
occurrence of elements and then combine these elements to gain the 
common stories* This work has been arranged so that the common ele¬ 
ments appearing in the stories can be tabulated for the five-year 
old boys, five-year ©Id girls and the total five-year old group, 
for the four-year ©Id group and for the pre-school group as a whole 
(3, 4 and 5 year olds). The common elements are then brought together 
to form the common stories*

Chapter II 


SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE 


A. Projection and Projective Techniquea 

Although it is not the purpose ©f this thesis to enter into 
a theoretical discussion of projection and projective techniques* it 
is thought necessary to discuss the problems encountered in trying 
to define these terms since it is upon these principles that the 
TAT and GAT are based. 

The term projection was first introduced by Freud as early 
as 1894 ~ "(the psyche) *..*aets as if it had projected this excitation 
into the outer world." (22) Used originally in connection with the 
psychoses and neuroses, it came to take its place among the defense 
mechanisms in psychoanalytic literature, as "a defensive process 
under sway of the pleasure principle whereby the ego thrusts forth 
on the external world unconscious wishes and ideas which, if allowed 
to penetrate into consciousness, would be painful to the ego." (25) 
However, with the increasing use of the term, the meaning has 
broadened until, as Van Lennep points out, "nowadays in America, 
projection is used to include all kinds of utterances and expressions 
of the subject as far as these are personal and not decided by th© 
rules of his society*" (46) Fortunately more and more authors are 
realizing the necessity of refining the concept of projection and 
are defining the various mechanisms which have been classified as 
projection* (1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 33, 39) 

While "projective techniques" as such have been in use for 

some time, the term was first introduced by Frank in 1939* (21)

He stressed the fact that in these techniques the subject interprets 
the stimulus in terms of what it means to ’’the personality who gives 
it, or imposes upon it, his private, idiosyncratic meaning and organ¬ 
ization,” 

Projection, in the sense it is used in projective techniques, 
has developed from the idea of a defense mechanism to the idea that 
the individual perceives contemporary stimuli in terms of past memory 
percepts. As Beliak states its ”w© are compelled to assume that all 
present perception is influenced by past perception, and that indeed 
the nature of the perceptions and their interaction with each other 
constitutes the field of the psychology of personality* 1 * (6) 

Beliak has recognized the problem and has emphasized the term 
^apperception” which he defines as ”sn organism’s (dynamically) 
meaningful interpretation of a perception*” (6) He offers the 
hypothesis that ’’there can be a hypothetical process of noninterpreted 
perception and that every subjective interpretation constitutes a 
dynamically meaningful apperceptive distortion * 71 He then goes on 
to define various degrees of apperceptive distortion of which 
projection is one* 

There seems to be a growing trend, in the literature, to 
recognize the fact that there are many different entities commonly 
characterized as projection, and that projective techniques as we 
know them now seem to measure varying amounts of these different 
kinds of projections in varying situations* These also imply that, 
to meet the needs of this type of test, the individual calls upon 
many other characteristic modes of expression and response, as well 
•as true projection, (l, 5, 6, 7, 10, 16, 17, 33, 39) It appears 







6 


then, that there is a great need for stricter, more carefully defined, 
terminology in this area, and also for more experimental studies to 
determine just what modes of adjustment the individual calls upon 
under varying circumstances. 

In applying this discussion to our present problem, it appears 
that there is no one generally accepted theory that would present an 
adequate rationale for a test such as the GAT. It is proposed that, 
by the use of normative data, more accurate interpretations ©f tests, 
such as the CAT may be obtained, and thereby make research attempts 
at understanding this problem more valuable.^ 

Except when discussing projection as a defense mechanism, in 
the discussions to follow the term apperception will be used. If, 
however, projection is used by any author the study will follow his 
style. This does not imply that B«llak*s theory is accepted fully, 
but only that it appears t© be the best and most complete theory 
available at present. 

B. Apperceptive Techniques 

1. Early Apperceptive T echniques for Use with Children 

a) The Thematic Apperception Test 

The Thematic Apperception Test is classified as a projective 
technique, but a great deal more than psychoanalytic projection is 
elicited on this test* The TAT is greatly in need of more research 
to provide a specific theoretical foundation as discussed previously* 
The third revision ©f the TAT consists of thirty-one cards 
marked so that there is a set of twenty cards for boys, girls, males 
over fourteen and females over fourteen. There are in the set three

pictures specifically designated for boys and girls, seven for 

Boys and Males and seven for Girls and Females* These, with the 

ten pictures used for both sexes and all ages make up the original 

cards for use with children four to fourteen* (32) 

b) Results of Several Investigations Using the TAT with Children 

Schafer and Leitch administered the tests to twenty-two three, 

four and five-year olds In a nursery school situation where children 

were admitted chiefly from broken homes or where the mother was 

working. (36) The Children were ranked on adjustment-maladjustment 

and the authors found the following indicaters of maladjustments 

"accumulation of unusual violently aggressive themes, blocking, and 

absurd perceptual distortions** 

In another study bySdiafer and Leitch, this time with five to 

seventeen-year olds with a mean age of eleven years, a comparison was 

made between psychotic and maladjusted nonpsychotic children on the 

first ten cards of the TAT. (31) The stories were interpreted in 

terms of organization, emotion, and perception and the authors were 

able to differentiate the psychotic from the nonpsychotic group on th© 

basis of disturbances in the areas mentioned, 

2 

Bell reports that Sanford has analyzed TAT stories told by 
fifty-two children in the age group five to fifteen according to a 
scheme of needs and general traits or attributes as developed by 
Murray* (4) Sanford then correlated these findings and found twenty 
syndromes of needs and traits which, while not mutually exclusive, 
proved to be useful constructs for comparing interrelations between

the personality, physical factors of the organism, and environmental 
conditions. 

Cox and Sargent gave the ten TAT cards to fifteen "stable" 
and fifteen "disturbed" seventh grade boys and scored their stories 
using a modified version of Murray* s system. (18) They found that 
there were certain objectively measurable differences existing between 
the groups. They further found that experienced clinicians were not 
able to spot the well adjusted children because of certain precon¬ 
ceptions (or frames of reference) in the clinicians* minds. They 
therefore emphasized the value of normative data for all age groups 

and both sexes, keeping in mind intelligence and socio-economic factors.

Rotter reports an unpublished study by Gerver who administered 
the TAT to fifty five to ten year old children. (35) The four pictures 
(76F, 18GF, 3GF and 8GF) which produced the highest percentage of inter¬ 
pretation (as contrasted to refusals, enumerations, or descriptions) 
were pictures characterized as containing real people with whom the 
subjects could easily identify. The four pictures most often failing 
to produce interpretation (19, 18BM, 11 and 12BG) lacked human figures 
and had an element of bizarreness, unfamiliarity or both. The study 
also indicated that failure to produce interpretations for more than 
half the pictures might be an expectancy below eight years of age. 

Various other studies are reported in the literature including 
research by Des Lauriers and Halpern in which the TAT was administered 
to children with schizophrenia before and after shock treatment. (19)

Wells reports research conducted with delinquents and nondelinquents 
using the TAT (41) and Sarason^ has used the test with mentally 
deficient children.^ 

Many clinicians felt, however, that the TAT was not a suitable 
instrument for investigation of children’s apperceptions because it was 
structured more on the adult level of response. The majority of pictures 
portray adults acting in an adult situation and leave little room for 
children to identify, and there is little chance for apperception to 
occur. This seems to be especially true for younger children, 
c) Apperceptive methods developed for child study, 1940-45. 

Some of the earliest techniques developed for use with children 
involved the modification of the TAT by including other pictures spe¬ 
cifically designed for use with children. In a study with neurotic 
children, Balken and Ian der Veer^ administered a set of twelve 
pictures using some TAT pictures (avoiding those that suggested death, 
murder, suicide or erotic fantasies), articles and magazine illustra¬ 
tions on child care and pictures taken from the scrapbooks of children 
previously under psychiatric treatment. They report, among other things, 
that in children younger than ten years of age the fantasies are more 
apt to be of a ’’forced” type, and that the immediate spontaneous 
responses are likely to be fragmentary enumerations or partial 
descriptions of some phases of the picture, (2, 3) The final pro -

duct ions (after further stimulation) were still fragmentary and 
repetitions of previous descriptions and enumerations were only 
occasionally interspersed with material of dynamic significance. 

Tbe material, for the most part, was shadowy and unattached to 
definite objects, people or situations.

'Amen studied individual differences in apperceptive reaction 
of preschool children on fifteen cards depicting ^experiences and 
interests” of preschool children. The study revealed definite trends 
in apperceptive reaction. The younger children tended to respond in 
terms of static form, concrete and literal interpretation, and a primi¬ 
tive unanalysed whole. With age the responses tended to include activity, 
even inner activity, involving thoughts and feelings, and tended also to 
be in terms of the whole picture with more attention to details. Self 
identification and the projective tendency itself was evident. 

c> 

In a study by Temple and Amen on anxiety reactions in young 
children, the experimental material consisted of a series of twelve 
pictures depicting situations familiar to the young child. The cards 
were quite ambiguous in that they could be interpreted either as a boy 
or girl and the face was left blank. Two separate heads were drawn for 
each figure, one with a happy expression and one with a sad exprevssicn, 
and the child was asked to select one of these to complete the central 
figure. The technique revealed different anxiety areas in the experience 
of young children, with a close relationship between behavioral adjustment

and patterns of anxiety* They also suggest the value of a normative 
study of anxiety in the interpretation of individual differences* 

In response to a series of pictures of fairly complex material 
administered by Vernon to children seven to thirteen years old, he 
found that, by the age of seven, the normal child gives simple des¬ 
criptions of pictures, which as age increases, gradually become fuller* ( 40 ) 
These descriptions in later years include actions and emotions in what he 
calls "partial interpretation". He found that it was not until the 
child was eleven or older that he was fully able to understand and inter¬ 
pret the picture as a whole, 

2. Later Developments in Apperceptive Techniques: 1945-1950 

a) 1 Comparison of a Set of Animal Pictures and TAT Productions 

A new set of cards was developed by Bills on the basis that the 
TAT was not suitable for young children because of the length of the story 
told, amount of description, and blocking on the test as a whole or on 
individual cards. (11) Bills took a series of pictures of rabbits 
from a children*s story book and compared the amount of material obtaihed 
with that obtained on the TAT. The preliminary work was promising but 
many of the children recognized the pictures and told stories resembling 
the original story* To combat this e new series of ten color cards 
described as "animals engaged in various activities" was designed, and 
administered to forty-eight school children, ages five to ten. Results 
of this experiment showed that the animal pictures surpassed the TAT on 
the basis of quantity of material produced, ease of formulation of 
stories, coherency and lessening of blocking*

Bills, Leman, and Thomrs further used the qualitative aspect 
of the test as compared to interviews and TAT scored on twenty-six 
of the needs proposed by Murray* (12) Their results showed that the 
TAT, animal stories and interview material were in partial agreement 
and that it ms reasonable to conclude that the study substantiates 
the claim that animal pictures and TAT are sound instruments for 
revealing manifest needs of children. They conclude that the animal 
cards are as valid and useful as the TAT and present an easier situation 
for projection of needs. They suggest, however, that the present set 
©f cards is not suitable to investigate specific areas of adjustment* 

It would seem from the results of these two studies that the 
animal stories give the child an easier opportunity for expressing his 
needs in story form. Moreover, that the quantity of material produced, 
by them is significantly greater than the TAT (though not yet of suffi¬ 
cient quantity to be clinically useful in that the authors have set a 
criterion of two hundred words for clinically useful stories)* The 
stories on the animal cards are more coherent and there is less blocking 
but the present cards are not suitable for the investigation of specific 
areas of disturbance in children* 
b) The Children’s Apperception Test 

The Children’s Apperception Test was specifically designed by 
Beliak to appeal to children. (8, 9) While apparently not based on the 
study discussed above, this work appears to fulfil their recommendations 
rather well. 

The rationale for the GAT was first suggested to Beliak by Kris, 
a psychoanalyst and educator* The task then was to design situations

which would have bearing on the dynamics of children’s adjustment„ 
Animals were used in the pictures on the basis that they might be 
preferred identification figures from three years up to possibly ten. 
The choice of animal identification figures has a further advantage 
in that it makes reasonable the administration of this test to chil¬ 
dren of other cultural groups. 

Eighteen pictures were drawn by a professional illustrator of 
children 1 s books* Violet Lament, some according to the suggestions of 
the authors and some according to her own ideas. The piatures, some 
of a M somewhat anthropomorphized nature and some entirely in animal 
fashion”, (9) were then photostated. The number of cards was further 
reduced to ten on the basis of study of the records and the experience 
of other psychologists who had worked with children* 

The pictures give children the opportunity to respond to many 
of the problem areas with which they may come into contact in our 
culture. 


The pictures were designed with the hope of eliciting 
responses tos feeding problems specifically, and oral 
problems generally; to problems of sibling rivalry; to 
illuminate the attitude toward parental figures and the 
way in which these figures are apperceived; to learn 
about the child 1 s relationship to the parents as a 
couple - technically spoken of as the oedipal complex 
and its culmination in the primal scene: namely, the 
child’s fantasies about seeing the parents in bed to¬ 
gether* Related to this, we wish to elicit the child’s 
fantasies around aggression; acceptance by the adult 
world, and its fear of being lonely at night with a 
possible relation to masturbation, toilet behavior and 
the parents’s response to it. We wish to learn about 
the child’s structure and his dynamic method of reaction 
to - and handling of - its problems of growth,” (9) 

Typical responses are given in the manual on the basis of 


one hundred cases

c) The Michigan Picture Test 

Another study of interest is that by Hartwell and associates 
on the Michigan Picture Test, which was developed to investigate and 
measure the emotional reactions of children of ages eight to fourteen 
years, at which time many find it difficult to verbalize their pro¬ 
blems . (24) Initially nearly one thousand assorted pictures were 
administered to subjects in this age range. The number was then re¬ 
duced to twenty plus a blank card. These were then divided into a series 
of twelve cards each, four being common to both sets. The pictures were 
selected according to a, carefully selected criterion, administered to 
three hundred and three Michigan school children, and a careful norma¬ 
tive study was made. Final results of the project unfortunately are not 
yet available but information on several areas of importance have been 
established. (E.g., ability to distinguish well and poorly adjusted 
children.) 

Holt suggests that the area of overlapping on the Michigan 
Picture Test and GAT is only partial and that the two tests seem more 
to supplement each other in that the CAT depends on animals for identi¬ 
fication figures and hence is probably more useful with younger chil¬ 
dren. (26) The Michigan Picture Test, using children for identification 
figures, will probably have more application with older children. 

d) The Blacky Test 

Mention should also be mad© of another test involving animals - 
Blum 5 s Blacky Test. (13) This test, originally designed for adults, 
involves twelve cards drawn in caricature, depicting the adventures 
of a dog named Blacky, The pictures are designed to portray "either a

stage of psychosexual development or a type of object relationship 
within that development”, including oral eroticism and sadism, anal 
sadism, oedipal intensity, masturbation guilt, castration anxiety 
(males) and penis envy (females), Blum administered the Blacky test 
(which he calls a modified projective technique) to one hundred and 
nineteen male and ninety female students in elementary psychology 
classes. He then used his data to study the psychoanalytic theory of 
psychosexual development, 

Blum points out that animal figures are used to facilitate 
personal expression in situations where human figures might be 
inhibiting, Micha1-Smith and associates have, however, found the 
Blacky Cartoons to be even more productive with children than with 
adults because of the ease with which the child can identify with the 
animal figure. (30) 
e) Story Completion Method 

Mention should also be made of the story completion method which 
is also related to the picture story test in that, although the stimu¬ 
lus-picture or incomplete story is different, the response-story is 
similar and it is quite possible that many of the same personality 
factors are at work in both instances. (31)

to response-expectancy* It is reported that there are several 

9 

research studies in progress on the normative aspects of the test. 

As far as can be ascertained there are no studies completed or in 

TO 

progress on the common stories of preschool children. 

However, using a somewhat comps,rable approach, Peters and 
Beliak are completing a study concerned with the development of a 
detailed scheme of apperceptive norms for the CAT using the technique 
used by Rosenzweig and Fleming for their study of the TAT. 

2. The Need for Normative Dat a 

The need for normative data centres around the clinician'^ 
inability to make an accurate diagnosis unless he has available a 
formal set of norms, Several authors have suggested that clinicians 
form their own set of subjective norms, but, besides the fact that 
the clinician must have several years of clinical experience to build 
up a backlog of cases for subjective evaluation, there is also the 
disadvantage that, because of the absence of explicit formulation, 
these norms are difficult to judge with any degree of objectivity* 

Added to this is the limited knowledge of differences due to sex, 
age, intelligence, socio-economic and cultural variables and others 
which may influence the responses* 

Cox and Sargent report an experiment in which the TAT profiles 
of fifteen well adjusted children were submitted to experienced 
clinicians who were asked to rate the profiles as "stable" or 

9. In a personal communication from Dr. Leopold Beliak, we received a 
"partial list of research, in current progress and/or completed, with 
the CAT". It is not clear from the titles of these projects whether 
or not they pertain to the work of this thesis. For the reader's 
information they have been listed in a separate bibliographical sheet 
entitled "Research on the CAT in Current Progress and/or Completed". 

10. Somewhat similar work has been done with respect to the TAT. See 

Kiefer (28), Stein (37), Rosensweig (34), and Fapaport (33).

"disturbed 51 . (IS) The results showed a significant error in rating 
the children and the authors , attempt to explain this in terms of "frame 
of reference" based on pathological subjects. In other words, most of 
the material available on the TAT is on pathological groups and hence 
the clinician sets up his own standards in which he expects normal sub¬ 
jects to be at the opposite pole in many of their elements® 

RosenZwieg points out that there are fundamentally two types 
of norms required in most projective methods and that for the TAT these 
may be designated as "apperceptive” and "thematic"® (34) Apperceptive 
norms are stimulus oriented and refer to the descriptive statements 
made by th© subject about the stimulus material. They enable the clinician 
to determine the degree of a subject's participation in group modes of 
behavior and also the responses which are deviant from the group and 
reveal the individual personality characteristics. They thus serve for 
both inter-individual comparisons and intra-individual comparison. Thematic 
norms are subject oriented and are concerned with the repetitions and the 
patterning of the whole record and involve the personality trends that 
consistently characterize the subjects in the group® 

There are certain cautions in the use of these apperceptive 
norms which must be noted in making interpretations® The similarity 
between individual and group may represent chance agreement of the group 
with the individual® To decide between chance agreement and true or signi¬ 
ficant agreement it is necessary to analyze the total configuration of 
agreements and disagreements, i.e., the thematic norms. Furthermore, in 
interpreting common behavior the psychological significance of the common 
element for the group must be realized® It is a question of whether that 





18 


activity is psychologically neutral or has underlying psychological 
significance for the group* In order to determine whether the psychologi¬ 
cal determinant of the group applies to the individual* it is necessary 
to rely on the thematic norms* In order not to abuse apperceptive norms 
it is necessary to realize the interdependence of apperceptive and 
thematic norms. 

Normative material, in acquainting the clinician with the 
material to be obtained from the test, further enables thedLinician to 
select cards to investigate specific problem areas, or, if time is a 
problem, to cut down the number of cards and select those which, on the 
basis of this normative material, will prove most useful, 

Kiefer (28) points out a further use for normative studies in 
research on reliability and validity. Her conclusions rest on the fact 
that the normative material allows for a more accurate interpretation, 
and this in turn yields results with higher validity and more reliability.

SELECTION OF SUBJECTS AND METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION 


A* Selection of Subjects 

All the subjects in this study were, at the time of testing, 
students at the Edmonton College Kindergarten.The subjects were 
not Screened” inasmuch as all the available students within the aga 
range three years zero months to five years eleven and a half months 
were used as subjects* There was a fairly large turnover in attendance 
at the kindergarten during the time testing was in progress (January- 
March, 1952) and as a result all the children were not tested. How¬ 
ever, all those who remained long enough to fit into the testing 
schedule were used* 

2 

Upon consultation with the lady Principal, it was decided that 
there was no immediate need to inform the parents as to the nature of 
the study. It was of such a nature that it could be included as one of 
the preschool functions. In addition the child was persuaded to feel 
that the testing was a part of the program* 

It was originally planned to set up three age groups - five-year 
olds, four-year olds, and three-year olds, and then combine these to 
give the norms for the total nursery school group. Unfortunately, 
there were very few three-year olds attending the school, so the 
original idea was abandoned but the three-year olds obtainable were tested and

included in the total nursery school group. Although the three-year 
olds have been left out of the theoretical discussions of this project, 
they are listed in the tables to show how the final total (i.e., the 
total nursery school group) was obtained* 

On further surveying the material obtained, it was found that 
sex distribution was unequal but that the five-year old group was large 
enough so that it could be split into two groups and then combined to 
give the total five-year old group. All information, then, will be 
given for three age groups (three, four and five-year olds) and the 
total nursery school group. The five-year old group will be further 
sub-divided into boys and girls. 

Tables I and II, below, show the sex distribution by ages and 
the mean age for each group.

The mean age of all groups averages slightly over the five- 
year level, but because of the greater number of five-year olds in the 
total group, the mean for the total group (five, four and three-year olds) 
is four years, eleven months and fourteen days or nearly five years. 

Because contact had not been made with the parents, and 
qualitative interpretations of individual tests were not given, a 
letter and questionnaire were sent to the parents by the Lady Principal 
requesting information for the Kindergarten files, (Appendix 4) It 
was planned to use this information in an attempt to determine the type 
of group for which normal stories were being established, since in using 
normative data, it is necessary to match the subject being tested with 
certain variables (e,g,, age, sex, socio-economic background, etc.). 

Points covered in the questionnaire which were intended to give 
an idea of the type of subjects used in this study included the following: 
marital relationship, economic aspect of home situation (whether the mother 
or father or both were working), number of siblings and their ages, and 
religious affiliation. Unfortunately only eighteen of the questionnaires 
were returned, but the Lady Principal was able to supply information on 
marital status and economic aspect of the home situation for fifteen more 
subjects. This brought the total in these two categories to thirty-three. 
The following Tables (Tables III, XV and V) indicate the returns on the 
questionnaires by age groups, and summarize the information obtained on 
marital status and economic aspect of the home situation for the thirty- 


three cases

It is to be noted that, while the rest of the subjects (some seventeen) 
can not be specifically judged on the percentages obtained so far, since 
the total returns would be based on fifty cases, the obtained informa¬ 
tion suggests that there is an abnormally high percentage of working 
mothers. 

B. Method of Administration 

1. Difficulties of Administering a Test to Young Childre n 

The difficulties inherent in testing young children, particu¬ 
larly preschool children, are adequately summarized in Ford. (20) These 
include the ease with which distraction occurs, and the frequency with 
which young children tire of a task which requires continued attention 
to one type of material. The sensitiveness of the child to the adult 
with whom he is working, and the difficulty for a stranger to establish 
rapport 5 the idiosyncracies of childhood behavior through which a child- 
reveals himself to those who know him but which are unintelligible to 
strangers; the language hazard, particularly in tests which deal with 
the subject*s ability to verbalize. 

Ford further points out the advantages of working with children* 
If the child knows and respects the examiner and the examiner knows and 
understands children rapport is easily Established. The child*s life 
is less structured, less inhibited, less concerned with cultural norms 
than that of the adult and he thus expresses himself more freely and 
revealingly in rapport with the adult. Especially does this appear to 
be true when the child accepts the adult and where he is not outvrardly 
challenged to competition. Other investigators report similar problems. 
(145 (15),(22).

2• The T es ting Situation 

Keeping in mind these specific difficulties in testing young 
children, the testing situation was constructed in the following 
manner to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages.*" 

Prior to the actual administration of any tests, the examiner 
worked and played with the children in the kindergarten atmosphere. 

The examiner also assisted teachers with the regular functions of the 
kindergarten, taking an active part in story telling and games. All 
of these activities in which the examiner participated were with the 
group as a whole* Individual child relationships were avoided in the 
attempt to prevent certain attitudes from developing. 

No particular effort was made on the part of the examiner to 
get to know the new children as they entered the school, for it was 
felt that this would mean singling out the child for special attention* 

It appeared, however, that once the examiner was accepted by the 
children as a group, the new children soon accepted the group's feelings 
and were anxious for their turn. 

During the test, the subjects were seated at a low table with 
the subject sitting at the examiner's right. As the table was larger 
than the ordinary children's table, it allowed the examiner to be close 
enough to the child to observe him, and yet the child was not unduly 
distracted by the examiner's presence. Both the subject and examiner 

" Some very helpful practice was obtained prior to the administration of 
tests to the experimental group by testing a different play school 
group involving 12 children, mostly 5 year olds. Here various 
instructions were tried out and the method of inquiry investigated 
(i.e. inquiry at the end of ten cards or after the 5th and 10th cards). 

The results of these investigations appear in the main text as the 
instructions and method of inquiry that were used with the experimental 
group. This play school group was under the direction of Mrs. D. E 0 Smith 








25 


were seated on small chairs, thus giving additional comfort and 
familiarity to the child# 

Tests were given in the living room of the Lady Principal 
and were preceded by several days by a Braw-a-Mar/' test administered 
by the same examiner, in the test room. With the younger children 
(three-year olds), the Draw-a-man was administered to two children 
at a time, thus allowing them to become accustomed to the test room 
but not at the expense of divorcing them from everything that was 
familiar. This was not felt to be necessary with four and five-year 
olds and they were tested singly* 

Although there were occasional interruptions while the test 
was in progress, the examiner tried to minimize the intrusion by not 
presenting new material until the disturbance was over. It was felt 
that, although they were distracting, the interruptions did not 
influence the rapport. 

3. Time of Testing 

The kindergarten is operated mainly on a day school basis but 
there are a number of pupils living right at the school. Day school 
pupils fall into three groups % (a) those attending in the mornings 

(9s30 — 1^*30 a.m.)j (b) those attending in the afternoons (1:30- 
3:30 p.m.)$ and (c) those attending all day. Day School children 
are also in attendance all day. The time of the child’s attendance, 
therefore, set the limits as to when he could be tested. Testing was 
carried out from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. and from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. Those 
attending in the morning were tested in the morning and those attending 

^ The test administered was Goodenough’s Draw-A-Man (23)

in the afternoon were tested then* Furthermore, there were 
facilities at the school for the younger children to take a nap 
in the afternoon and it was necessary to test the three-year old 
children in the morning. The pupils attending all day were worked 
into the testing schedule in both the morning and afternoon* 

4• Test Materials 

In ell cases the material was prepared before-hand* Pencils, 
paper, stop watch and CAT cards were ready for use and table and chairs 
were in place* 

5• P reliminary Administration - the Draw-a-Man 

As mentioned above the Draw-a-Man was administered to the 

children singly (four and five-year olds) and in pairs(three-year olds) 

7 

to acquaint the child with the examiner and the testing situation* 

The child or children were brought into the testing room and 
seated at the small table. The examiner started off by explaining to 
the children that whenever they came to the testing room they would 
play a game. Two pencils were on the table in front of the child - 
a big Jumbo sized children’s pencil and an ordinary pencil* As the 
instructions were given, a piece of paper was handed to the child and 
he was allowed to place it in the manner desired. The following 
instructions were given; 

n Now today I want you to take a piece of paper and a pencil - 
you may take whichever kind of pencil you like, and Draw a Man for 
me. w 

If the child hesitated the instructions to draw a man were 
repeated. If he asked what kind of man he was told any kind of man 
7 

Unfortunately time has not allowed the analysis of these drawings 
which, with the stories, would make a very interesting study.

he wanted. If the child insisted he could hot draw a man he was asked 
to try. In all cases the child was encouraged (non-directively) with 
the drawing and liberal amounts of praise were given. 

In only one instance did a child refuse to draw a man, and 
he complied with instructions on a second date a week later. (The same 
child after overcoming his initial fear was very willing to do the CAT.) 

At the conclusion of the drawing of a man, the children were told 
that the examiner would like to have them come back to the testing room 
at a date to be specified by the examiner, when they would play another 
kind of game. All children, without exception, were willing and eager 
to come back a second time. 

6. Administration of the CAT 


On entering the room for the administration of the CAT the child 
was seated and the Draw-a-Man made on the previous occasion was presen¬ 
ted and the child complimented on the drawing. The following instruc¬ 
tions were then given; 

!1 Today we are going to play a story telling game. I am going 
to show you some pictures (at this point the pictures were drawn out 
from the folder and held in the examiner f s hand with the back of the 
pictures toward the child) and I want you to make up a story about 
these pictures. Describe what is happening now. Tell about the 
thoughts and feelings. Tell how the story started and how it will 
end. n 

The first picture was then presented to the child and the 

g 

examiner timed the various elements and copied down the story. 

At the conclusion of the first story the examiner stated, 

"that was a very good story. Remember I want to know what is happening 
now, the thoughts and feelings, how the story started and how it will 
end.” 

The child was then presented with the second card. 

The remaining eight cards were handed to the child one at a time

with the instructions, "Now tell me a story for this picture 1 ** 

7. Inquiry on the CAT 

At the conclusion of the ten cards, the examiner commented; 

! ’Now those were all very good stories but this time I would like to 
go through the cards again and ask you some questions about them.” 

The examiner then placed the appropriate card in front of 
the child, reviewed the story the child had given for the picture and 
asked for any of the elements omitted, i.e. past, present, future 
thoughts and feelings. Questions were asked in the following order 
and manner. Presents If the child had described the picture he was 
asked, "What are they doing now in the picture ? n If the past was 
omitted, he was asked, ’’What happened before this — what was the 
beginning of the story?” Questioning for the future was, "What 
happened after that, what was the end of the story?" For thoughts, 

"What are they thinking about in their minds?” and for feelings, "What 
are their feelings, how do they feel about it all?” 

The word ’’they” was used in instructions and inquiry in 
place of the word "animals” because it was found in the initial trial 
tests that in some cases the identification was so complete that the 
child resented the word animal and/or that it interrupted the flow 
of material when he realized it was animals for whom he was structuring 
a story. 

8. Recording 

Of the several methods of recording — typewriter, hidden 

9 

microphone" and handwriting, the last was chosen. The low tone in 

9 Hartwell et al report losses as high as 30% of statistics electrically 
recorded due to mechanical difficulties. ( 24 )

which many of the children talked, the novelty of the situation and 
the distractibility ruled out all but the last possibility. The 
handwriting method, too, had its drawbacks in that it was not possible 
to record verbatim in a few cases, 10 but it is felt that the main 
ideas were recorded in the manner given by the child and that it is 
only the statistics on length of story (i.e., number of words) that 
have suffered. Again it is felt that even this can be approximated 
fairly accurately* 

/- -....-

Chapter XV 

METHOD OF ANALYSIS 

A. Analysis of Formal Characteristics 

There are, in general, two methods of dealing with the 
imaginative productions elicited on a test such as the TAT or CAT. 

The first method is by analysis of the formal characteristics, i.e*, 
analyzing the data for significant elements. The second method is 
content analysis, where the meanings that are attributed to the data 
are ascertained. Both methods are dependent on the same story 
material and ere closely related. Various methods of interpretation 
have been developed emphasizing either the formal aspects or content 
analysis or the relationship of both methods. (4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 26, 28, 
32, 33, 35, 37, 38). 

For this study, it was decided to analyze the stories for their 
formal characteristics. This has been don© for two reasons: (a) in 
interpreting stories, the clinician must first consider the analytic 
aspects and then interpret them in relation to his particular subjectj 
(b) this thesis deals with normative material, implying that elements 
are to be abstracted from stories and their frequency determined. 

Thus in considering the formal characteristics, we have set the 
stage, so to speak, for the content analysis. Furthermore, in 
charting the frequency of these elements we have further refined the 
possible area of interpretation. 

This study, then, will attempt to abstract the formal 
characteristics of story structure and story content in the form of 












elements which can then be tabulated by statistical procedures to 
gain a frequency count and differentiate the common from the uncommon 
elements. The common elements will then be pulled together to give 
the common stories for our groups of nursery school children® 

The terms Characteristics of story structure’” and Character¬ 
istics of story content* 1 are the same as used by Rapa port (33) but 
they will be used in a slightly different context here. 

Characteristics of story structur e will deal with the subject* 
manner of reacting to the stimuli (pictures) together with the product 
of that reaction; the structure and content of the story itself. 

This method, in that it involves evaluation by the examiner of the 
subject’s response and story, is necessarily somewhat subjective. 
However, the various characteristics have been defined as exactly as 
possible in the attempt to eliminate subjectivity. 

Characteristics o f story content will be concerned strictly 
with the abstraction of the various elements from the story production 
and the operation here is on a fairly objective level. 

The Method 

The method of analysis for formal characteristics finally 
decided upon is as follows; 

1. Subject Identification

C. Description of Categories and Sub-categories 

I. Subject Identification 

The productions of the subjects in the various age groups were 
numbered in the following manner: Group 1, Age 5, were numbered in 
Arabic numbers from 1 to 30 ; Group 2, age 4 were lettered in capital 
letters A to 0; Group 3, age 3 were numbered in Roman Numberal I to V. 
II• Time Elements and Story Length 

1. Reaction Time : the length of time in seconds from the presentation 
of the card until the story is;.doimnenced. . 

2. Total Time : the length of time in seconds from the presentation of 
the card to the completion of the production. This interval includes 













33 


all pauses, periods of questioning by the subject, and answering 
by the examiner* 

3* Story Time : the total time in seconds taken to tell the story, 
i.e*, total time minus reaction time* 

4. Story Length ; the number of words contained in the story, 
including inquiries by the subject. 

Ill* Characteristic of Story Str uc ture 

1* Approach Approach to the problem is a product of reaction time, 
story length and elements of the story. Sub-categories are; 

a) Rejects : the subject refuses the card altogether or fails 
to see the animal in the picture. 

b) Hesitant : there are two possibilities here (i) a long 
reaction time, usually with much preliminary questioning as to what 
**it n is, or (ii) fairly short reaction time but very little material 
(number of words) given over a lengthy story time. 

c) Accepts : there are three possibilities here, a short 
reaction time with (i) a short story length, but with definite elements 
included, (ii) average story length but only a general description, 
(iii) a complete story. 

2 0 Flew of expression This category is a product of the story 
length and the individual elements of the story* Both the main story 
and inquiry were scored for this category* Sub-categories are as 
follows; 

8 ) Very Constricted ; the story length is very short (or even 
zero) and there are no elements of story content included in just a 
general description of the card*

b) Constricted : the story length is short but at least 
one of the individual elements of the story is included* 

c ) Natural : the story length is average and takes the form 
of elaboration of one element or several simple elements. 

d) Free : the story length is above average with two or more 
elements elaborated. 

e) Very Free : the response is given as a complete story and 
usually contains past, present and future with a good amount of 
elaboration* 

3* Type of Story This category refers to the type of w story M given 
in response to the instructions* Results are on a continuum from 
a narrative giving all or nearly all of the story elements to a simple 
description of the card. There are three main sub-categories with 
several divisions under this heading: 

a) Narrative s this category entails a logical sequence of 
events taking place for the picture, 

b) Explanation : an explanation is given of what is happening 
in the picture* There are two sub-categories here, (i) simple 
explanation where the explanation indicates what is happening right 
now in the picture, but nothing else; (ii) complex explanation tells 
what is happening now in the picture and either explains why it is 
happening or what the logical consequences will be. 

c ) Description : the child simply describes or enumerates what 
he sees in the picture* This description can take three forms, (i) 
description or enumeration of objects in the picture, (ii) description 
or enumeration of characters and (iii) mixed, a combination of these 
w ith the child enumerating or describing both characters and objects* 

















35 


4„ Organization This implies the child’s ability to construct 
a logical story. It is scored on two levels, the first indicating 
the child’s ability to tell a story as a result of the instructions 
only. The second indicates the child’s ability to tell a story with 
prompting, i.e., the main story and inquiry are scored as one unit. 
There are four sub-categoriess 

a) Confused s the story in itself is confused, irrelevant, 
illogical, or fantastic data are included. This category could not 
be scored too consistently as what seems illogical to the adult may 
have great meaning to the child (e.g., the mouse eats the lion on 
card 3). Therefore, only when the child changed the main stream of 
his thought radically or was confused within himself was this 
category scored. 

b) Loose ; there are two possibilities for scoring this 
sub-category, (i) The minor illogical elements are included in the 
production, but the general thread of the story is still intact. 

(ii) The story or description is accurate but it is too short to 
actually deserve being called a **story”. 

c) Somewhat organiz®d : a fairly logical sequence of events 
but the story is not quite complete. 

d) Organized ; a logical sequence of events telling a fairly 
complete story. 

5. Spontaneous Elaboration When the child starts to verbalize on 
the story elements upon presentation of the card for the inquiry 
and/or upon the reading of his story by the examiner before any 
questions have been asked in the inquiry for that card, we have what 









36 


is called here spontaneous elaboration. The child spontaneously 
verbalizes on the card without stimulation to do sc by the examiner. 

This verbalization can take several forms, 

a) Old Material ; information already given in the main story is 
(i) repeated with none of the elements changed or (li) extended with 
the material essentially the same as in the main story, but doubts 

may be erased or one aspect changed (e.g. settling on the sex of the 
’^person w ), 

b) New Materia l: material which ted not been included in the 
main story is given. The two divisions here are (i) lengthy when 
several new elements are added spontaneously and (ii) short when only 
one new element is added, 

c) Mixed s old material may be repeated or extended and some 
new material added, 

6* Realism The extent to which the animals conform to the standards 
of reality, i.e,, act like human beings. Sub-categories includes 

a) Reality influenced : the artels act entirely as human 
beings would act in a similar situation, 

b) Reality Free s only animal-like behavior is shown in the 

story* 

c) Mixed elements of both human and animal behavior appear 
in the story, 

7, Mood This is the general emotional tone of the production 
as a whole and depends on the outcome of the story and thoughts and 
feelings where these are included in the story. Sub-categories here 


are as follows?

a) Happy : this mood is related to the accomplishment of 
the goal, with its accompanying feelings of achievement or pleasure. 

b) Neutral ; this indicates an uneventful sequence of events. 

c) Unhappy : an event or act harming the hero, or the hero 
harming someone else. 

d) Tragic : this is more serious than unhappy and involves 
the death of the hero or someone else. 

17. Characteristics of Story Content 

1. Individual Elements Within the Story 

a) Setting : this includes the time, the place and the weather 
conditions which the picture suggests to the subject as the background 
of the story. 

b) Situation : the subject *s interpretation of the activity 
depicted in the card. This is usually a one-word abstraction of the 
present. 

c) Main hero : the hero is the person or persons (animal) 
with whom the subject primarily identifies. He is the one whose 
point of view is adqfced in the story, who shares the subjects senti¬ 
ments and aim, whose reactions are most dramatically described and 
whose inner feelings and motives are portrayed. 

d) Others ; other people or animals appearing in the pictures, 
or introduced by the subject, with whom the main hero interacts. 

e ) Description of Characters : this includes the kind of animal 
seen, his place in the family, and an approximation of his age (e.g., 
"little" or "big"). 

f) Figures or Objects Introduced : figures or objects which do

not appear in the picture but which the subject introduces into 
the picture* 

g) Figures or Objects Omitted ? figures or objects appearing 
in the story which the subject fail# to include in the story or which 
are not seen by the subject* 

2* Individual Elements of the Story 

a ) 13 b st : this is the action which has happened before the 
situation depicted in the picture, of which the situation is the 
resultant* 

b) Present ; this is essentially the same as the situation 
but is a more complete description of the interaction of forces 
depicted in the picture. 

c) Future : in the logical sequence of events the future will 
follow the action depicted in the picture, and should contain the 
outcome of the story* 

d) Thought s: the mental functioning of the hero as he 

interprets or reacts to the situation* 

e) Feeling s; the emotional reactions of the hero as he reacts 
to the situation* 

f) Theme ; the theme is essentially an abstraction of the 
past, present and future and is a resultant of the hero’s reaction to 
the situation and the other characters in the story* 

D, Application of the Method 

1* Description of the Analysis Sheet and Method of Tabulation 

An analysis sheet ^was drawn up with the appropriate headings 
across the top and the subject’s identification data in the first 
^ See pp.43a for a sample of the analysis sheet used in this study. 














39 


column on the left hand side of the page* A separate sheet vras used 
for each group, for each card. This allowed analysis on both the 
vertical and horizontal planes. Reading across the horizontal plane, 
it is possible to obtain the summary for a complete picture for the 
individual. This could further be extended to reading the summaries 
for the single individual on ten cards, thus allowing a thematic summary 
for the ten pictures. On the vertical plane may be obtained a summarized 
statement of the individual elements or characteristics for a complete 
group of subjects for each picture* 

The stories were then separated into the three age groups, 
with the five-year olds further subdivided into boys and girls. The 
method of analysis adopted entailed analyzing the stories for each 
subgroup, one card at a time. Thus the fifty stories in the total group 
were analysed for each card separately. It w&s thought that this method 
would give a greater consistency in handling the various elements and 
their relation to the card and story than if the stories had been 
analyzed for the ten cards by one subject at a time, or ev§n by one group* 

As the number of stories analysed for each card increased, so 
too did the familiarity with the material, and the ease of extracting ele¬ 
ments and spotting descriptions that might prove significant. To ensure 
greater consistency, the stories, after once being analyzed for the 
ten cards, were then re-read card by card and any elements omitted or 
neglected were inserted. 

2. Actual Tabulation

Time elements and Story Length. Reaction time and total time 
were transcribed directly from the record to the appropriate columns 
on the analysis sheet. Story time was obtained by subtracting reaction 
time from the total time. Story length was estimated as accurately as 
possible by counting the number of words in the production and estimating 
for' "linking" words that had been omitted. (E.g,, n 'and* t ,”or”, "but”, 

!t as w , etc.) 

Characteristics of Story Structure. These elements were estimated 
as closely as possible from the correspondence of the story to one of 
the definitions in the category, and a check (v) put in the appropriate 
column. Where two elements were scored (i,e,, on flow of expression where 
the main story and the inquiry are scored and organization where the main 
story and story plus inquiry are scored) results of the story alone were 
scored in black and inquiry or story and inquiry were scored in red. 
Unfortunately, it was not possible to define objectively the number of 
words or the time interval to be considered short, medium or long, 
because of the interdependence of the number of variables considered. 

These categories were retained in the final analysis, even though they 
are fairly subjective ratings, because it was felt they offer informa¬ 
tion that could not be obtained in any objective manner. 

Characteristics of Story Content. As far as possible a single 
word has been charted in the various categories here, However, in 
some cases, there appeared to be two elements of equal importance to the 
subject and these have been charted as a double response. (E.g,, Card 8, 
situation drinking-talking.) 




41 


Individual Elements of the Story, These elements were tran¬ 
scribed as nearly as possible in the subject *s own words. Some 
abstracting was done, but in most cases the actual words were recorded, 

3o Tabulation For Common Elements of Story Structure and Content 

The manner of tabulating story structure allowed for a simple 
addition of the elements to give the final total for the various sub¬ 
categories, Tabulation sheets were next drawn up for each element of 
the story content with the age categories across the top. In the left 
hand column the statements made by the individuals were entered and 
as the analysis sheet was worked through, similar statements made by 
individuals in the different age groups could be tabulated and brought 
together. The next step was to bring those elements with the same 
ideational content, but which were expressed somewhat differently, 
together. This set the way for the determination of the frequency of 
common elements* 

4. Determination of Frequency of Common Elements 

This topic is defined as a study of "common stories" and it 
is therefore necessary to determine what percentage of the sample group, 
and consequently of the total population, might be judged significant 
as related to the common response. In other words, it is neeessary to 
determine a percentage above which responses may be termed "common" 
and below which they are non-significant for a study of common stories, 

Roserzweig uses a 20$ level of frequency to determine apperceptive 
norms on the basis that this criterion is in "substantial agreement with 
the general practice for *popular* responses in the Rorschach method." (34a)

In another approach,Kiefer selected the 10$ level in the sample 
group, which, using the probability graph of 95% confidence limits as 
employed in a binomial distribution, yields a 5% significant level in 
the total population, (28) She points out that basic to the selection 
of a level of significance is the consideration of the group with which 
one is working. Moreover she justified selection of the 10% level on 
the basis that her cases were very carefully selected and that by 
screening procedures she had selected a more nearly homogeneous group 
of subjects within the normal range. 

Unfortunately, subject information on the present sample group 
is limited. As far as could be ascertained, none of our subjects was 
under psychiatric guidance at the time of testing, but there was evi¬ 
dence that one had been receiving attention previously. With these 
aspects in mind, it was decided to base the common stories on elements 
at the 20% level of significance, but to include the 10% level of signi¬ 
ficance in the tabulations as a further indication of what might be 
expected on the test. Both levels of significance have, therefore, 
been included in the tabulations. 

Using the 20% level of significance in our nursery school group 

and using the probability graph ”95% confidence limits of a binomial 
2 

distribution”, it is observed that the sample group yields a 10% signi¬ 
ficant level in the total population, i.e,, total nursery school pop¬ 
's 

ulation. (42) Having thus defined the level of significance at the 
20% level in our total nursery school group, the frequency of signifi¬ 
cance can be given for the various age groups (Table VI). Frequencies 

2 Appreciation is due Mr. A. Shaw, Department of Mathematics, University of 
Alberta, for his suggestions regarding the use of this probability grapho 

3 It is to be noted th&t many of the elements reach a frequency greater than 
the 20% level and these would then occur above the 10% level in the total 
population. 





falling below these levels of significance are defined as unusual or 
non-significant, and those falling above these levels as significant, 
and they will be used for the compilation of common stories.

Is mentioned earlier, both the 10% and 20% level of frequency 
will be given, but only those of 20% or more will be used to compile

* three main groups and for the subgroups to indicate how the total ms

THE RESULTS 


A♦ Revision of Analysis Sheet for Tabulation Purposes 

lo Outline 


The application of the method of analysis described in the last 
chapter has resulted in three types of information,, 

a) The mean and standard deviation have been obtained for the time 
elements and for story length* 

b) Characteristics of story structure have been tabulated and results 
significant at the 20% level have been underlined* 

c) Characteristics of story content have been tabulated on frequency 
tables for both the 10% and 20% level of significance and those at 
the 20% level have been underlined. 

Some slight changes have been made from that of the outline 
presented in the last chapter. It is therefore necessary at this 
point to present an outline for the data actually tabulated,

4s testing progressed, it was realized that the *total time 55 
for the ten cards would not give an adequate idea of the average 
period of administration. To try to remedy this, the total adminis ¬ 
tration time was recorded as closely as possible from the time the 
instructions were given for the CAT until the inquiry had been com¬ 
pleted on card 10. 

The two categories under characteristics of story content have 
been combined, in that they will be used in this form for the com¬ 
pilation of common stories. D@scription has been added to setting 
and situation, when necessary, in order to give a more complete idea 
of the elements used by the child. For example, if the furniture in 
the room seems to be an element of the story, it has been tabulated 
under setting. If there were various elements that seemed important 
but secondary to the main action, these have been tabulated under 
description of the situation. 

Four elements have been omitted from characteristics of story 
content. Present and theme summary are omitted because it is felt 
they are adequately covered by other elements in the tabulation.

(Present is covered by situation and description of the situation 
while all the elements together combine to give the theme summary.) 
There is a great lack of understanding and confusion of thoughts 
and feelings even with adult subjects, leading to omissions end 
rejectionso (28) With children the problem is even greater, and 
besides omissions and rejections are found perseveration and a con¬ 
tinuation or amplification of the future. In few cases do the ele¬ 
ments of thoughts and feelings relate to the actual story. For 
these practical reasons, then, these elements have been omitted 
from our present study. 

3o n Omitted** and "Others ” 

Single ideas, or ideas which did not reach the 10% level of 
significance, are grouped together in the tables under the term 
others. Items omitted or rejected ere classified together under 
the heading omitted . These categories, although seemingly meaning¬ 
less, serve to give a better idea of the child f s response to the 
pictures. The first shows the degree of variation in the single 
area and the second indicates the aspects of the picture which do 
not elicit responses or which create difficulty in response. Further¬ 
more, these categories are necessary to compute the individual totals 
lor each group (equal to the number in the group) and the nursery 
school total of fifty.

B. Time Elements and Story Length 

The following discussion will concern the time elements 
and story length* All times, except Total Administration time, 
are recorded in seconds* The story length is in words per story* 

For each element the range, mean and standard deviation is tabulated, 
with the mean and standard deviation taken to the second decimal. 
Table VII provides data on reaction time for all the groups 
on the individual cards* Table XI summarizes this information for 
each group for the ten cards. The only significant figure is that 
showing a longer reaction time for all groups on the first card* 

This would indicate the initial n shock-reaction”^ or the initial 
difficulty the subjects felt on being presented with the pictures. 
Group 2 shows a higher mean reaction time on the total cards and 
also the greatest range in reaction time* In explaining this, it 
may be possible that,as the subjects grow older, they find it 
easier to adjust to new problems. 

Table VIII shows the total time similarly arranged for the 
ten cards and Table XII shows the total obtained for each group 
summarizing the ten cards. It is apparent that the longest total 
time is given on Card I, which is probably the result of the pro¬ 
longed reaction time and initial adjustment to the testing situation. 
Group 2 shows the shortest total time and also the greatest range in 
total time. Comparing this with the results found on reaction time, 

^ The term "shock-reaction” is used to indicate ego disorganization. 
In this sense it may possibly be compared with "color shock” as 
employed by Klcpfer and Kelly. Klopfer, B. & D, Kelley, The 
Rorschach Techniques , N.Y., The World Book Co., 1946, p. 385

where Group 2 showed the highest reaction time* it would appear 
possible that age may again be a factor and that the subject’s 
ability to express increases (within limits) with age. 

Table IX gives the story time, the total time taken to tell 
the story, for each group on each card* Table XIII gives the 
story time for each group on the ten cards. From these it is seen 
that Group 1 gave the shortest story time on Card 1, while Group 2 
gave the shortest time on Card 1C. Group 1 appears to have found 
the initial adjustment situation most difficult, and to have 
recovered from the H shock-reation' n on succeeding cards. Card 10 
seems to have had a definite inhibitory effect on Group 2. The 
mean for the ten cards shows Group 2 to have averaged the shortest 
time for the 10 cards, again pointing out the possibility of an age 
factor influencing the adjustment to the situation. 

Table XIV shows the total administration time for the groups 
in minutes. While the story time (Table XIII) averages 41*74 seconds 
per card, the total time for the test averages 41*83 minutes. Adding 
several seconds per card for the extra time it took to complete writing 
the stories after the story time was obtained, and for the presenta¬ 
tion of the next card, it can be estimated that it took approximately 
ten to fifteen minutes to administer the cards. Thus the inquiry 
consumed approximately twenty-five minutes. This is an indication of 
the duration and probable importance of the inquiry. 

Table X indicates the story length in words tabulated for 
each card. Table XV summarizes this information for the various

groups for ten cards* From these it can be seen that Group 1 
and the Total Group told the shortest stories on Card 1, again 
indicating the difficulty the children had adjusting to the pro¬ 
blem and the recovery, notably in Group 1, from the ^shock-reaction”. 
Group 1 also averaged the the longest stories on the cards and had 
the greatest range in story length* It is to be noted here that 
Bills has set 200 words as the criterion for a story to be cLinically 
significant. (11) Using this criterion, very few stories in this 
study would approach clinical significance« However, it is to be 
noted that the inquiry, on the whole, was of greater length than 
the original story (except in the case of narratives) and also 
brought forth many more story elements* The number of words in the 
inquiry has not been tabulated because it is felt that this would 
also give an erroneous impression! inasmuch as most of the subject! 
included several new ideas, there was usually a repetition of the 
main story as well* This would seem to indicate the necessity of 
other criteria considering the inquiry for evaluating the clinical 
significance of the story* 

In summary, Group 1 shows the shortest reaction time, longest 
total time and correspondingly greater story time, with a greater 
story length* This would seem to indicate that there is a definite 
age influence on time elements and story length* fThese findings 
are also born out by the results of Group 3* but as mentioned previously, 
the group is too small as a basis for final conclusions.) The duration 
of the inquiry also indicates the probable importance of this aspect*

C. Characteristics o f Story Structure, Content and Common Storie s 

This section will be arranged in the following manner? a 
discussion will be outlined on each of the three sections of story 
structure, story content and common stories, then the actual tabula¬ 
tions for story structure, content and the common stories will follow* 
The data will be arranged so that the complete material for one card 
will appear together. To aid in the understanding and evaluation of 
the stories in relation to the cards, the description of the picture* 
card taken from the test manual will precede the section on that card. 

Before considering the various story elements, it is interesting 
to point out that rejections of the cards occurred in only two cases. 
In both instances this was on Card 1 in the three year old group and 
there was a recovery on the inquiry (in one case a spontaneous elabor¬ 
ation after the fourth card had been presented). The inquiry was 
rejected on twelve occasions and almost exclusively by Groups 2 and 3 . 
This would again suggest the influence of age on the ability to cope 
with the situation, 

1. Characteristics of Story Structure 

These elements, as mentioned previously, are fairly subjective 
©valuations, but they have been included here because it is felt they 
will give information that could not be obtained by any other means 
and which will be of value in structuring the common stories. It is 
to be noted that a complete tabulation has been made, i.e., elements 
have been included even if they have not reached the required fre¬ 
quency, This has been done to facilitate comparison between various 







53 


elements on different cards. However, for convenience, elements 
significant at the 20$ level have been underlined* 

a) Approach. Accepts is the elements of greatest significance on 
approach to the problem. On only one card, Card 1, is hesitant 
greater than accepts . Hesita nt is significant on Cards 1, 2, 3, and 
10 and rejects does not reach the significant level on any cards. 

This would seem to indicate that, after the first "shock-reaction”, 
most of the children are able to adjust to the situation. 

b) Flow of Expression. In general the main stories are constricted 
and improve to the level of natural a f ree or very f ree in the inquiry. 
The main story reaches significance on very constricted only on 

Card 3.0, probably indicating some inhibitory effect of this card. 

On only three cards does the main story reach significance on natural . 
Neither free nor very free is significant, apparently. 

The inquiry does not reach significance on very constricted and 
only reaches this level on constricted on cards 2 and 3. Both 
natural and free reach statistical significance on every card. 

These findings would appear to indicate that an increase in the 
flow of expression is brought forth with the inquiry and would tend 
to emphasize the value of that technique. 

c) Type. Stories are predominantly simple explanation . The only 

other elements reaching significance are complex explana t ion on 

Card 9, descriptions of characters on Card 6, and mixed description 

2 

on Card 10. This would seem to confirm the difficulty of Byrd , 
^Personal communication January 1952.

another investigator with the C&T, who had difficulty trying to 
get children to tell a story in the full sense of the word. 

d) Organization. The main stories are predominantly loose with 

at least 30 of the 50 stories being scored in this category on every 
card. The material only reaches statistical significance on somewhat 
organized three times (Cards 4, 9, 10) and on organized once (Card 2). 

The story plus inquiry reaches statistical significance on 
somewhat organized on every card and on organized on eight cards 
(all except 5 and 8). They are loos® only once (Card 5) but are also 
confused on four occasions (5, 6, 7 and 8). 

These findings would again indicate the significance of the 
inquiry in bringing about a better organized story. However 3 it is also 
apparent that more confused stories were obtained with the inquiry* 

e) Spontaneous Elaboration* None of the elements under spontaneous 
elaboration reach statistical significance but it has been retained 
to indicate the cards that produce this type of information with the 
greatest frequency (cards 4 and 7)* 

f) Realism. The action in the stories is predominantly human action 
and is significant on nine cards (not on card 7). Animal action is 
significant on two cards (Cards 6 and 7) and. mixed on four cards 

(1, 3, 6 and 7). The decision to use human or animal associations 
seems to be in the card as a stimulus, and appears to be governed by 
whether or not the animals are seen in a human situation or setting. 
However, this boundary is not rigid as can be seen from the over 
lapping on the data sheets for these elements*

The above findings would definitely seem to bear cut the 
supposition that animals serve as easy life-situation identification 
figures for children (8, 9, 11, 12). 

g) Mood. The predominant moods are neutral and unhappy . Neutral 
is significant eight times (not card 3 or 7) and unhappy nine times 
(not on card l), Happy is significant only once (Card 4) snd tragic 
is significant twice (Cards 3 and 7), This would seem to confirm the 
findings of other investigators who have found a great many aggressive 
themes (both unhappy and tragic in this study) in children’s stories* (36) 
2. Characteristics cf Story Content 

As mentioned previously, elements reaching both the 10$ level 
of frequency have been-tabulated, and to aid those using the dat®, the 
20$ level cf frequency has been underlined* 

a) Setting. This element has not been included in the stories, too 
consistently,but does appear on five cards (Cards 1, 2, 4, 5 and 10). 

b) Situation. This element usually allows categorisation fairly 
specifically of what was happening on the card but in several 
instances this action x>fas depicted in the past or future (notably 
Cards 7,9 and 10). 

c) Main Hero. There was great difficulty in scoring this category 
as the children seemed to identify with each animal as they were 
mentioned in the story. This would possibly indicate a somewhat 
plastic concept of ’self 1 which allows many identifications. Generally, 
the children identified with the group as a whole or with the member 
of the group approximately the same age as themselves* 
















56 


d) Otherso This category was mainly concerned with the mother and 
father and aggressive figures (figures in the pictures or introduced). 
Secondary identification showed up here to a great extent by the children ! s 
identification with those nearest their own age if primary identification 
had been with the group. 

e) Description of characters. Although a significant number of children 
saw the animal in the picture as what the arti3t had drawn it to represent, 
a great many called it by other names« However, this proved no hindrance 
to identification, for if the child did not know the animal in the 
picture, he usually substituted the name of one he did know, 

f) Figures or Objects Introduced. A great many figures, both human and 
animal, were introduced into the stories. The fact that a figure was not 
on the card proved no drawback to the child. Some objects were introduced 
but on the whole this category was not significant. 

g) Figures or Objects Omitted, Some figures were significantly omitted 
but these appeared to be the ones that were not too easily distinguished. 
Further investigation will be needed to determine the significance of both 
figures and objects omitted. 

h) Past. The most significant feature of the past was that it was 
omitted on an average of 42 . 8 $ of the time for all cards, with a range of 
28$ to 52$* ' Explanation for this might be found in the child*s inability 
to understand the test instructions or it might be the result of the 
child*s own inadequate background of past experience, 

p 

This feature is significant for all age groups, but particularly so 
for Groups 2 and 3 where it averages 59$» 








57 


i) Future* Only four cards reached a significant frequency for omissions 
on the future (Cards 2, 4> 8 and 10). This may possibly be one of the 
advantages that animal cards have over TAT pictures, Cox and Sargent, 
in this respect, found that "nearly half (of the stories )were in this 
category (without endings) suggests that children quite commonly overlook 
the instructions to state the outcome and find it difficult to resolve 
a plot", (18)^ However, the methods of administration in the study by 
Cox and Sargent may quite possibly differ from those used here and this, 
then, would not be a general conclusion* 

The only theme running through the future elements is that of 
aggression (it is to be noted that this does not always reach a statisti¬ 
cal frequency)* This may indicate the child 1 s helplessness or lack of 
foresight with regard to his environment. In many cases the "aggressor" 
is not specified^ (e*g* appears as; someone, something, etc*) and would 
seem to indicate a free floating apprehension* 

3. Common Stories 

The common stories to follow this discussion are the final 
fulfillment of this thesis topic. The prose account is formulated on the 
basis of statistical tabulations for the total preschool group. 

/ Unfortunately the selection of the 20? level has not resulted 

in an overwhelming abundance of elements. Particularly under the cate¬ 
gories of past and future has it been difficult to find significant 
elements* However, it is considered more valuable here, to have one story at 

a higher statistical frequency then to have several at a lower frequency 
and thereby sacrifice validity. 

3 See report of the study by Cox and Sargent, p. 8 supra 
^ Balken and Vender Veer also found material of this type. See the report 
of their study on p. 9 supra.

Card 1 . 

C. Common Story 

The Approach to the stories on this card is predominantly 
hesitant , but a significant number accept the situation. The Flow of 
Expression is characteristically constricted in the main story but 
improves to natural in the inquiry. Simple explanations are the pre¬ 
dominant Type. Organisation of the main story is loos ® but becomes 
somewhat organized . or organized with the addition of the inquiry. 

Most of the stories are based on human actions but a significant number 
are mixed (i.e., animal and human actions). The predominant mood is 
neutral . 

The Setting is concerned with the meal time and a further des¬ 
cription concerns what the animals are eating. The main her© is usually 
the Chicks which are seen as ’they® , or ’chickens* and described as 
’little* or’baby*. “Others® in the story is the Large Chicken seen as 
a ’rooster®. 

The past is omitted of the time or is concerned with the 
’Large Chicken preparing food for the little Chicks’. Although no one 
element is significant in the future, an element of ’aggression* (Chicken 
aggressive to Chicks) could be formed by considering the data for both 
Chicken eats Chicks and Chicken eats food of Chicks.

Organization in the main story is loos® , and in the story plus inquiry 
is somewhat organized or organized . Realism is predominantly on the

’sitting’. The Main Her© is the Lion seen as a lion or dog. Others 
include the mouse seen as a mouse, and characterized as being ’little or 
baby’. Figures introduced•include both ’animals’ and ’humans 1 and 
there are a number of ’objects’'introduced, The mouse is omitted 44% 
of the time. 

Past is omitted 40% of the time and no other category is signi¬ 
ficant, No category reaches significance in the future, however, 
but a significant category of’the Lion showing aggression to the Mouse® 
could be obtained lycombining the data for ’Lion tries to catch mouse* 
and ’lion catches mouse’.

It is to be noted that 'going® (to the store or somewhere) appears 
in both the past and situation (present) and 1 coining 1 (home) appears in 
both the situation (present) and future* The main theme thus centres 
around the 'kangaroos going somewhere® (to the store, picnic etc*) and 
then * coming home® with actions centering around the 1 child riding his bike' 
'the mother carrying the basket and the baby®, and *the baby carrying a 


balloon'

for the main story is natural or free and for the inquiry is natural or 
free . Type is simple explanati on. Organization for the main story is 
predominantly loose and for the story plus inquiry is somewhat organized , 
confused or loose . Realism is predominantly on a human level. The mood 
is neutral or unhappy . 

The setting is in a ’house® and it is ’night’ time. A Further 
Description of the Setting includes the crib seen as a ’feed* or ’crib 1 ® 

The Situation is ’sleeping’ with a Further Description ©f the Setting 
including the fact that ’both the baby bears and the parents are seen 
in bed®. The Jfein Hero is predominantly the Baby Bears with Others as

C. Common Story 

Approach to the story is predominantly accepts . Flow of Expression 
for the main story is constrict ed and for the inquiry natural or free . 
Type is simple explanation , Organization for the main story is pre¬ 
dominantly loose and for the story plus inquiry somewhat organized , 
organized or confused . Realism is on an animal level or mixed . Mood 
is unhappy or tragic . 

The Setting is Outside* (jungle, woods, forest etc,). The 
The Situation is concerned with the 'Lion trying to catch the Monkey', 
the 'liofa going to eat the monkey' and the 'Lion chasing the monkey'. 

The Main Hero is the Monkey or the Tiger (equal significance) and Others 
include the Tiger, Monkey and figures introduced. The Monkey is seen 
as a 'monkey* and the Tiger as a 'lion' or 'tiger', A significant 
number of figures is introduced. 

The Past is omitted $2% of the time and nothing else reaches 
the level of significance. The Future is concerned with the 'Tiger 
catching and/or eating the Monkey'* 

It is to be noted that the 'Lion chasing the Monkey' appears in 
both the past and situation (present) and the 'lion eating or going 
to eat the monkey' appears in both the situation (present) and future 
adding added significance to both these themes.

C♦ Common Story 

Approach to this card is accept s or hesitan t. Flow of Expression 
for the main story is constricted or v ery constrlcted fl and for the 
inquiry is natural or f ree . Type is simple explanation or mixed 
description of characters and objects. Organization for the main story 
is predominantly loose , but somewhat organized is also significant. 

For the main story plus the inquiry, organized or somewhat organized 
are significant. Realism is predominantly on a human level. Mood is 
unhappy or neutra l» 

Setting is the 'bathroom* with description including the 'toilet* 
(either described ©r used in the story). Situation includes 'spanking* 
and the *Baby Bog wanting to go and/or going to the bathroom*. The 
Main Her© is the Baby Bog but both dogs (they) occur a significant 
number of times# Others includes the Adult Dog and figures introduced. 
The Baby Bog is seen as a 'dog* or 'puppy* and described as *little or 
baby*. The Adult Bog is seen as the 'mother* or 'father*. Figures 
Introduced are predominantly animals. 

The past is omitted 28% of the time and the future 20% and none 
of the other elements are significant. However, as has been noted, 
'spanking', 'Baby Bog wants t© go /or is going to the toilet 8 and the 
'Adit Bog washing or drying the Baby Dog* appears in the past, present, 
and future and add significance to these themes.

CHAPTER VI 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The main purpose of this thesis has been the production of 
common stories as told on the CAT by nursery school children. The 
normative data obtained have been presented in the following forms: 

(i) statistical tables of reaction time, total time, story time, 
total administration time and story length; (ii) frequency tables 
of story structure; (iii) frequent tables-of story content; 

(iv) prose statements of common stories. 

A* Discussion of the Validity of the Approach Used in this Thesis 

The following discussion will attempt t© evaluate the validity 
of this project by relating the normative data to the experimental 
group of nursery school children, the method of administration and the 
method of analysis* 

1* - Subject Information All the subjects used in the nursery school group 
were, at the time of testing, students at the Edmonton College Kinder¬ 
garten. All the children who could be worked into the testing schedule 
were administered the CAT. On the basis of age, the children were 
divided into three groups i Group 1, five year olds. Group 2, four year 
olds and Group 3, three year olds* 

Unfortunately there were several factors which prevented calling 
the group a ff normal, preschool group”. The first concerns the age of 
the children which averages nearly five years (4 years, 11 months and

14 days)* Although the individual groups all average slightly over 
the 5 months level for their respective ages, the predominance of five 
year olds in the total group raises the group average* The average 
age is then higher than the ideal average age of four years for a 
group composed of these three age levels* 

Another difficulty arising from the subject data concerne the 
three year old group (Group 3) which is too small to warrant the basis 
of any final conclusions* Moreover, the sex distribution predominantly 
favors the boys* 

Perhaps the min problem in this area concerns the paucity of 
information regarding the type of group which offered the stories* 

It would have been ideal to present such items as the marital status of 
the parents, the number of siblings and place of the child in the family 
constellation, the economic conditions ©f the home, the cultural level 
and bickground of the family and the religious affiliation* ( 24 ) 
Unfortunately very little of this information became available for the 
experimental nursery school group. While the information available 
probably does not represent the group, a significant conclusion points 
to a very high percentage of working mothers. Other workers report 
such a background for their subjects. (36) 

In using the normative data obtained then, it will be necessary to 
consider them as temporary criteria and recognize their deficiency as 
applied to the total group because of age factors, numbers in the groups, 
the predominance of boys in the group, and the lack of specific subject 
information* While these are fairly definite indications of a lack of

validity for the common stories, it is possible that the following 
factors have minimized this conclusion. 

2. Method of Administration 

The administration was organized while keeping in mind the 
special difficulties of testing young children. 

Preliminary contact was made with the children in their own 
setting, i.e., the preschool environment. Following this contact was 
made with the children individually or in pairs (depending on age) in 
the test room for the administration of a preliminary test. This was 
done to acquaint the children with the examiner and the testing situa¬ 
tion. With this preliminary establishment of rapport, it was then 
possible to proceed with administration of the CAT under fairly good 
conditions. 

The efficiency of the administration procedure may be judged 
from the fact that,after the preliminary administration of the Draw-AHMan, 
all children were eager to return to the testing situation for the 
administration of the CAT. Only two rejections of the card occurred 
and these were in the three year old group on the first card. The 
inquiry on these two rejects was comparable to the child’s productions 
on other cards. The inquiry was rejected eleven times on various cards 
but these were mostly in Groups 2 and 3. It is considered that the 
rejections were more a result of age of subjects than the administration 
procedure. 

Having structured the administration to meet the needs of young 
children and minimized the difficulties of testing this group, the

results obtained appear to indicate that the testing situation was 
fairly well designed to elicit productions that would be an adequate 
representation of the child of this period. 

3. Method of Analysis 

To produce valid normative data the method of analysis itself 
must be valid and reliable. The method of analysis for Story Structure 
was necessarily somewhat subjective. However, by careful defining of 
the elements and a re-reading of the data by cards, a fairly reliable 
indication of what to expect in the various categories was obtained. 
Many of the elements appeared consistently and thus gave a very high 
degree of significance, adding further emphasis to the validity of the 
approach, 

Analysis for story content was on rather more objective level, 
and the validity was increased by recording the subjects own words 
on the analysis and tabulation sheets and then abstracting the common 
elements. 

The standard ©f significance for common elements was set at the 
20% level of frequency because of the difficulty in definitely defining 
the subject information for the experimental group. It is postulated 
that this level of significance partly compensates for the lack of 
the necessary subject information in that it is high enough to eli¬ 
minate ideas which would be presented by ’minority groupings’ of 
children should they appear in the group. 

In summary, then, it appears that, while the preschool group 
used in this study may not fully represent the preschool population

because of unequal distribution of age* background and sex* there 
is reason to believe that it is a representative nursery school group* 

Again* the method of administration and analysis would seem to 
have at least partly compensated for these otherwise unbalancing 
features* It would appear that the results for the group tested are 
valid for that group* and that in applying this information to the 
preschool population the normative material can be used with some 
degree of confidence* 

B* The Result s 

Having discussed the validity of the separate factors which 
interact to produce the validity ©f the results, it is now possible to 
summarize the conclusions which may be drawn with respect to th© results* 
1. Time elements and Story Length } The most significant factor here appears 
to be an age factor* Group 1 average a shorter reaction time, longer 
total time* longer story time and greater number of words. It would 
appear that* with increasing age* even in one year intervals, the 
subjects become better able t© handle new problems with efficiency* 
Longest reaction times occurred on Card 1 for Group 1* after which the 
reaction time decreased with some consistency for the remaining pictures* 
It would appear from this that the initial problem ©f adjustment was 
great, but on the basis of experience* the children were able to 
handle succeeding pictures more adequately* Th© younger groups, on the 
other hard* appeared to find the nature of the stimulus-picture somewhat 
disturbing* with the result that certain pictures had an inhibiting 
influence on reaction time*

Another important finding was the length of the inquiry 
which doubled that of the administration of the main cards. It is 
also possible that the length of time consumed in the inquiry is an 
indication of its value in turning up response materialo 

2 . Characteristics of Story Structure . 

Generally the characteristics of story structure may be 
summarized as follows; Approach to the problem, after the initial 
hesitant reactions on Card 1, was fairly consistently accepts ; 

Flow of Expression for the main stories was on the whole constricted ; 
but with the addition of the inquiry became natural or free ; Type of 
story was predominantly simple explanation s Organization for main 
stories was loose but for the story plus inquiry was somewhat organized 
or organized ; Realism seemed to depend on the nature of the stimulus** 
picture, but whether human or animal did not lower the significance of 
the production! Mood was predominantly neutral or unhappy , with a 
significant number of aggressive themes. 

From this summary, it appears that the stories themselves were 
not •stories* in the full sens© ©f the word. However, with the addition 
of the inquiry they came much closer to this criterion. After an 
initial hesitancy the children were able to adjust to the problem. 

It appears also that animals are adequate identification figures for 
children. 

3. Characteristics of Story Content . These characteristics may be 
summarized as follows; the Setting in most cases is not significant; 
Situation generally depicts what is happening in the card, but these

elements may also be found in past and future; it is difficult to 
ascertain the main hero but generally these have been found to be 
the group as a whole or the one most closely resembling the subject 
in age; Others generally include the mother, father and aggressive 
figures; there are a great many Figures Introduced and Figures 
Quitted tend to be those that are not too easily distinguished on the 
card; Past is omitted a significant number of times by all groups, 
but particularly by the younger groups; Future is omitted fairly 
often and themes of aggression appear to run through this element. 

It would appear from this summary that elements generally seem 
to revolve around the family constellation, which, actually, is 
reasonably the urn in environment of the child, A great many aggressive 
figures enter into the stories, some specified and some not, which may 
indicate the child f s uneasiness or fear of the environment. Further 
the child appears to identify with the character about whom he is 
talking which would seem to indicate a "self-concept" which has not 
been fully formulated. It is possible that the child*s Him® orien¬ 
tation" is not too specifically constructed with the result that the 
setting appears in both the past and future* Past is significantly 
omitted while future is often omitted. The child would seem to be 
trying to cope with reality, yet in his own fashion. If mother and/or 
father were not depicted in the picture, he usually introduces them,

frequency tabulations (20$ level of significance) of the tot&3 
nursery school group. The level of significance selected has not

resulted in a great many significant stories, but it is probable that 
the validity of the story or stories is greatly increased* 

From the general conclusions presented above which find ful¬ 
fillment in the prose accounts of the common stories, it would appear 
that the CAT presents a fairly good indication of the child’s reaction 
to and handling of its problem of growth* More specifically, the CAT 
presents indications of the child’s attempts and stage in adjustment, 
specific needs, fears and his reaction to and handling of aggression. 

The common stories, then, give the clinician a fairly useful 
statistical basis for interpretation of CAT protocols* Further, they 
may serve as a basis for selection of specific areas to be investigated, 
or omission of cards if time is a factor* They also have an application 
in research projects where more valid interpretations will lead to 
more reliable and valid results* 

The objective of this thesis has been primarily the construction 
of a set of common stories for the GAT* With the presentation of 
normative data, and eomon stories, this thesis project is assumed to be 
fulfilled* The results obtained may be used as a basis of comparison 
for nursery school children with a fair degree of validity* 

Furthermore, a method of administration has been developed 
which appears to be valid* Experimentation was done on both the 
instructions and method of inquiry, and the techniques presented in this 
thesis seem to produce the best results.

Chapter VII 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

From the foregoing summary and conclusions certain recommendations 
can be made regarding normative material for the CAT® 

A. Recommendations for the use of CAT normative data with nursery school 
children* 

Results of information obtained in this thesis have been pre*- 
sented in two formas (i) statistical and frequency tables and (ii) prose 
accounts ©f common stories for the total group® Both types of data have 
application in the interpretation of the CAT® The frequency tables show 
the degree of significance of each element with particular reference to 
the age ©f the subjects and serve almost as a rating scale against 
which t© evaluate the significance of various elements in the productions. 
The common stories provide a fairly general f though more complete idea 
of the interaction of the elements to form the story. 

The application of the normative data obtained in this study 
was discussed in the last chapter. It remains t© caution against the 
misuse of such information. Interpretation of a subjects agreements 
with the norms necessitates a configurational approach both with respect 
t© the various responses of the individual and to the psychodynamic 
context within which the norms themselves exist. 

B® Recommendations for future normative studies® 

The main recommendation for future studies ©f normative material 
on the GAT is concerned with the type of group used in the study. Such

information as age, sex, marital status of the parents, economic 
conditions of the family, the number of siblings and the child*s place 
in the family must all be considered 0 

It is suggested that an adequate nursery school or preschool 
group might consist of 120 subjects, allowing 40 subjects at each age 
level, with an equal distribution of sex. The other important background 
information (e.g. marital status, etc.) would have to be worked out in 
relation to the group and the importance of the various aspects. 

Research should also indicate if norms for nursery school children will 
adequately represent the preschool population* 

The instructions for both the story and inquiry used in this 
study appeared to produce adequate results when the two elements are 
taken as a unit. It is possible, however, that other instructions 
might bring forth the same amount of material in the story alone, 
although the preliminary experimentation with different approaches 
failed to do so* 

The Draw-4-Man test seemed to produce an adequate basis for 
establishment of rapport in this project* It is suggested that some 
preliminary test is needed t© break down the child f s initial resistance 
and introduce him t© the testing situation and the examiner. A test of 
the Dr&w-A““Man type is brief and easy to administer, similar to the 
tasks of the Nursery School Classroom and is enjoyable for the child 
and hence presents a method ©f easing the child into the situation.

Furthermore, the results of the Draw-A-Man, or a similar test like the 
Machover 1 Draw-A-Person, will produce additional interpretative material* 
It would also be interesting to interpret the stories within the 
analysis frame work used in this thesis* 

Another recommendation deals with the inquiry, which appears in 
this study to be a very important element. Adequate technique must 
be established for evaluating the significance of the story and inquiry* 
The importance of Figures or Objects Introduced is also to be 
determined. Perhaps more important is establishing the significance 
of various elements (pictures and objects) that are omitted. It 
remains to be seen if these omissions are merely overlooked because of 
the vagueness of the card or if they have underlying psychological 
significance* 

The analysis scheme itself may b© extended to include other 
significant elements* Also a more- objective manner of analysis for 
elements of story structure may be developed. 

A further analysis must also be done to determine the thematic 
norms for the groups, since apperceptive and theme,tic are interrelated 
to such an extent* 

Normative studies ©n other cultural groups are also desirable. 

The CAT, because of the animal identification figures, presents an ideal 
instrument for these studies. From comparison with other cultural 
groups, the effect ©f various cultural variables may be ascertained* 
and the instrument may itself serve as a valuable apperception technique 
for that culture*

Another important field for investigation will be determining 
normative data for other normal age groups to which the CAT is 
applicable. This study has indicated significance of age for one 
year intervals,, This would necessitate normative data for other ages, 
using a fairly short 8 step interval* in ages„ 

Further research will have to be done with maladjusted children 
to determine norms for these groups as research to date suggests that 
maladjusted children d© not differ from normal children in one consistent 
degree or direction® 

These are but a few of the recommendations for more extensive 
studies with the CAT. It is felt that this important area in person¬ 
ality development has been long enough neglected®
