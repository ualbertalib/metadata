ABSTRACT 


A study was conducted on the meiotic behaviour of a 21 
chromosome haploid of Triticum vulgare and its progenies* 

Metaphase I and anaphase I of meiosis were not clearly 
differentiated, but chromosome counts were made when the univa¬ 
lents had migrated to the poles* Random distribution to the poles 
was apparently restricted by the presence of true bivalents and 
secondary pairing* When no pairing occurred, the distribution 
of univalents appeared random* 

One, two or three bivalents were present in 67*5^ of 
the cells counted. The presence of true bivalents indicated 
considerable homology between chromosomes not normally considered 
homologous* No bridges or fragments were observed* 

A few cells contained a completely reduplicated set of 
chromosomes* In these cases, lj.2 chromosomes were present. It 
is believed that chromosome doubling with failure of cell wall 
formation in a sporogenous cell prior to microsporocyte form¬ 
ation, resulted in the duplications observed* 

Chains of 3* 4, and 5, were observed in the haploid* 
These associations appeared as continuations of secondary pair-

The F 2 and F^ generations were studied cytologically* 
Although a high frequency of aberrations was observed, a general 
trend toward a normal complement of chromosomes was indicated 
in later generations. Univalents, trivalents and quadrivalents 
were the most frequent aberrations. It is postulated that 
crossing-over between partially homologous chromosomes in the 
haploid resulted in reciprocal translocations which were trans¬ 
mitted to succeeding generations. Deficient and duplicated 
gametes resulting from such translocations probably gave rise to 
aneuploid plants with various types of associations in later 
generations.

A STUDY OP MEIOSIS IN A 


HAPLOID OP TRITICUM VULGARE AND ITS PROGENIES 


R» C. McGinnis 


INTRODUCTION 


A haploid plant contains the gametic number or only 
half the normal chromosome complement* Haploids are usually 
somewhat dwarfed and less vigorous than their sister diploids, 
and their reproductive organs are correspondingly reduced in 
size* They occur rarely in most species under natural con¬ 
ditions, and presumably arise from parthenogenic development 
of an egg cell or an accompanying synergid* 

Because of the aberrant chromosomal behaviour during 
meiosis, haploids are generally highly sterile. Theoretically 
however, they need not be completely sterile, for no matter how 
many chromosomes a species may have, a certain percentage of the 
eggs and sperms should contain a haploid set of chromosomes.

Union of such gametes would give rise to a diploid plant which 
would be completely homozygous for all characters* Diploids 
could also be obtained from haploids by the union of unreduced 
gametes. Such diploid plants would be of considerable value 
for studying the genetics of quantitative characters* 

Haploids have been of interest in the study of the 
phylogeny of a species. Cytological observations of the extent 
of chromosome pairing tendencies in haploids, have given inform¬ 
ation concerning basic chromosome numbers and relationships in 
the species studied. 

A practical application of haploidy has recently been 
demonstrated with the derivation of monosomic lines in common 
wheat* Monosomies in turn, have been found of value in assoc¬ 
iating certain genes with specific chromosomes and may also prove 
to be useful for transferring inherited characteristics by a 
method of chromosome substitution from one variety to another. 

In Triticum vulgare , haploids are primarily of inter¬ 
est in a study of chromosomal associations between genomes, and 
the meiotic behaviour of unpaired chromosomes. Aberrations in¬ 
volving whole chromosome deficiencies or duplications, and re¬ 
ciprocal translocations observed in the progeny of haploids, 
make possible a more complete study of linkage and inheritance 
in this species.

In this paper the results of cytological investigations 
of chromosome behaviour at meiosis of a haploid of Triticum 
vulgare and its progenies are presented and discussed. 


LITERATURE REVIEW 


Occurrence 


Work on haploid plants has become prominent only in 
recent years and records of haploidy are still rare# The first 
haploid seed plant was described by Blakesiee, e_t al (1), in 
1922* Two such plants appeared in the offspring of normal 
Datura plants which had been subjected to low temperatures 
at the time of fertilization# Since this initial work by 
Blakeslee, et al (1), haploids have been found from time to time 
and described in about 20 genera of plants.

Origin 


There has been much speculation as to the origin of 
haploids# According to Cooper (3), Harland (3), and Muntzing 
( 19 ), poly-embryony or twin-seedlings appeared to be one of the 
more frequent sources# Harland (8), in a germination experiment 
with Sea Island cotton, observed 20 seeds containing two embryos, 
one of which was usually much larger than the other# Prom such 
material l6 pairs of plants were raised to maturity; of these 
llj. pairs consisted of one haploid and one diploid, and two pairs 
each of identical diploids# Cooper (3) observed a number of 
haploid-diploid twins in Lillium and Nicotiana# He suggested 
that this phenomenon occurs when a synergid is stimulated to 
divide and that many of the haploid plants discovered arise 
from synergidso 

Crosses between distantly related species have in a 
few instances given rise to haploids# Gaines and Aase (7) 
obtained a haploid with 21 chromosomes by pollinating a winter 
wheat, Triticum compactum humboldii with the pollen of Aegilops 
cylindrica # In this cross, usually only shrivelled seeds resulted 
but the single plump kernel which produced the haploid was 
much larger than seed of the Triticum parent#

Gaines and Aase (7), suggested that both generative nuclei of 
the Aegilops pollen fused with the maternal endosperm nuclei to 
produce a tetraploid endosperm, while the egg developed parthen- 
ogenically# Smith (23), discussing wide crosses such as the 
one described by Gaines and Aase (7), postulated that, ’‘possibly 
the endosperm v/ith two maternal and one paternal set of chromoso¬ 
mes is capable of developing; but the embryo with one maternal 
and one paternal set dies, in which event a synergid or an already 
partially developed maternal embryo, develops into a haploid 
embryo”# 

Various artificial methods have been employed in pro¬ 
ducing haploids# Cold treatment was used by Blakeslee, et al (1), 
in Datura# It was postulated that the low temperature caused the 
parthenogenic development of the egg cells# Ivanov (9), Katayama 
(10), Kihara and Katayama (12), Kihara and Yamashita (13), 

Kostoff (lip), and Smith (23), have attempted the production of 
haploids by the use of X-rays# Ivanov (9) believed that X-rayed 
pollen produced a significant increase in the number of haploids 
in Nicotiana rustica var# humilis # His work was corroborated by 
Kostoff (lip) on similar material# Katayama (10), Kihara and 
Katayama (12), and Kihara and Yamashita (13) obtained significant 
increases in the incidence of haploidy in einkorn from the use 
of X-rayed pollen# Smith (23), hov/ever, found no increase in

einkorn haploids from X-rayed pollen* Actually fewer haploids 
were obtained in one experiment when such treated pollen was 
used* 

Delayed pollination has been used as a means of in¬ 
creasing the occurrence of haploid plants* Kihara (11) reported 
that if pollination of einkorn wheat was delayed beyond the nor¬ 
mal time after emasculation* the frequency of haploids was corre¬ 
lated (to a point) with the length of the delay* He also observed 
three pairs of twin seedlings which presumably arose from delayed 
pollination© 

Lindstrom (1?) described a tomato mutant which had 12 
chromosomes© It appeared in the population of a varietal 
cross and showed complete fertility* Lindstrom (1?), regarded 
this haploid as 11 spontaneous M , as no apparent stimulus was re¬ 
sponsible for its production* 


Meiotic Behaviour 


Meiotic behaviour of haploids has been studied by a 
number of workers; (2), (1+), (5), (6), (7), (9), ( 15 ), 

(l6), (17), (18), (20), (23), and (25)« To date there is no

general agreement since each, species has apparently somewhat dif¬ 
ferent meiotic characteristics* 

Random distribution of the chromosomes to the poles 
was observed by Bleier (2), Davis and Kulkarni (!}.), Gaines and 
Aase (7), Ivanov (9), and Tometorp (25)# Gaines and Aase (7) 
found that pairing occurred only rarely in their 21 chromosome 
wheat plant* The chromosomes apparently were distributed to 
the poles at random* Davis and Kulkarni (Ip) in their studies of 
an Oenothera francisca haploid, found that none of the seven 
chromosomes paired* Sterile pollen resulted from the irregular 
distribution of the chromosomes in the first division; (6+1), 
(5+2), and (lp+3)• They postulated that functional pollen grains 
resulted when a unipolar spindle had formed and all seven chromo¬ 
somes were drawn to one pole* Ivanov (9) studied a haploid of 
Nicotiana rustica and observed that chromosome pairing was almost 
entirely absent* At metaphase I the chromosomes lay scattered 
over the entire spindle* 

In some Matthiola hybrids, Lesley and Frost (1$) ob¬ 
tained a haploid which had seven univalents plus a fragment. 

No pairing was observed* In some cases, random distribution of 
the unpaired chromosomes occurred, but frequently the chromosomes 
split and separated* In these cases the first division was evi¬ 
dently omitted and pollen dyads resulted.

Emerson (5) studied a haploid of Oe* franc1sea 
but did not observe the same behaviour as that described by 
Davis and Kulkarni (ij.) * He observed two chromosomes fre¬ 
quently attached end-to*end* The behaviour of these two chromo¬ 
somes apparently differed from that of the other five univalents* 
In early anaphase I, the members of the pair usually passed to 
opposite poles while the other five univalent chromosomes were 
distributed at random 0 Counts of the chromosomes in the two 
daughter nuclei showed the following distributional 7 cases 
(7+0), 25 cases (6+1), 18 cases (5+2) and 15 cases (l|.+3)» 

Emerson concluded that the high frequency of the (6+1) dis¬ 
tribution was the result of the frequent movement to one pole 
of all five univalents, with one member of the dividing pair* 

Recently, instances of chromosome pairing in haploids 
have been reported, (2, 6, lij_, l6, 18, 20, 23, and 26 )* These 
workers however, do not agree in their definitions of chromo¬ 
some pairing nor in their interpretations of its significance© 

Levan (l6), who studied meiosis in haploid rye, occas¬ 
ionally found two bivalents and one trivalent at diakinesis© 

The presence of numerous chiasmata apparently held paired chromo¬ 
somes together even to metaphase I* He did not believe that 
chiasmata could form between non-homologous chromosome portions 
and therefore concluded that pairing was between chromosomes that 





- 9 - 


were actually partially homologous* Kostoff (llj.) was of the 
opinion that in haploid einkorn, pairing had nothing to do with 
chromosome homology but occurred between inert heterochromatic 
regions* 

Yamasaki (26 ), in a Triticum vulgare haploid, observed 
the following pairing frequencies at metaphase I; 21* - 4-7*7$* 
l^l" - 37.1$* 17 f 2 n - 12*4$, l£»3” - 2*4$, and 13- 0*4$* 

An occasional trivalent was also noted and taken as an indication 
that a relationship existed among the three genomes* 

Smith (23) found a low percentage of open bivalents with 
observable chiasmata in einkorn haploids* More frequently, how¬ 
ever, he found chromosomes arranged at first metaphase so that 
they might be considered as two secondary pairs* He suggested 
that this might be taken as evidence that five is the basic 
number of chromosomes in wheat. Smith (23) considered two 
chromosomes as secondary pairs if they were not more than the 
diameter of a chromosome apart at any one point* Only a small 
number were paired throughout their entire length. 

In Arbtlc Grass haploids, Flovic (6) concluded that 
real homology involves the exchange of chromatin and secondary 
pairing may occur as a result of phylogenetic affinity of chromo¬ 
somes without intimate homology* He pointed out that secondary 
pairing may be caused by mutations or structural changes of the 
chromosomes, but is probably evidence of a lower basic number*

Nordenskiold (20), in a haploid rye plant, observed a 
bivalent in 3*2% of the pollen mother cells which were cytolo- 
gically examined# This bivalent was always rod-shaped and 
appeared to be joined by a chiasma# Bleier (2) suggested that 
bivalent formation is not constant in haploids and that factors 
other than strict homology (e.g* the chance sticking together 
of chromosomes from prophase on), have a greater influence on 
pairing* 

Morinage and Fukushima (18) studied meiosis in a hap¬ 
loid rice plant and found that pollen mother cells contained one 
or two bivalents# Those at the equator were considered as true 
bivalents# Tomtorp (25) found that a bivalent was formed in 
of the pollen mother cells of a Hordeum distichum haploid# He 
did not believe that bivalents are a secondary phenomenon but 
that they may arise through relic similarity of chromosomes# 

The appearance of chromosome bridges at first or second 
anaphase of haploids has been reported by a number of investiga¬ 
tors# Levan (l6) frequently observed chromatin bridges without 
fragments in a rye haploid# He suggested that their presence 
could result from chromatid reunion# Katayama (10) and Smith 
(23), working independently, observed bridges in einkorn hap¬ 
loids which had fragments occasionally associated with them# 

Smith (23) found a high correlation between the number of bi¬ 
valents and the number of bridges# He pointed out that these

bridges probably resulted from crossing-over between non-homol- 
ogous chromosomes and, "if this interpretation is applicable 
to the bridges in haploid einkorn, it would suggest that crossing- 

over had occurred between most of the bivalents# .. it 

thus follows that true chiasmata were observed"• 

To date. Sears (21) has made the most practical use of 
a haploid plant* He obtained two haploids from the cross T# 
vulgare pollinated by Secale cereale * When pollinated with 
normal wheat pollen, one plant produced lip seeds and from these, 

13 plants matured* These plants and their progeny were examined 
cytologically, and Sears (21) observed 11 plants with an aberrant 
chromosomal complement* Univalents, trivalents and rings of 
four were found in conjunction with normal bivalents* Since 
Sears (21) was unable to examine the original haploid cytolo¬ 
gically, he could only postulate the probable cause of the 
aberrations (monosomies, trisomics, etc*), observed in the F^ 
and subsequent generations*

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


In July, 19U-9> a Haploid of Triticum vulgare was ob¬ 
served in an F^ experimental plot of the inter-varietal cross, 

Lemhi x (Bunyip x Dicklov/)* It was not noticed until flowering 
time when the spreading of the glumes, characteristic of ster¬ 
ility, drew attention to it* It Is not believed that the hap¬ 
loid arose through twin embryos as only one plant was present* 

Three slightly dwarfed and spindly tillers were present; 
two in flower and the third young enough to allow cytological 
examination of the pollen mother cells* Tills spike was removed 
and fixed for cytological studies* 

Of the two remaining spikes, one was allowed to seif- 
pollinate while the second was emasculated and pollinated with 
normal Lemhi pollen* Emasculation was probably unnecessary 
since the selfed spike proved to be completely sterile* Heavy 
rains in mid-July, stimulated the formation of two more tillers 
which were also emasculated and pollinated with Lemhi pollen* 

^he three cross-pollinated spikes produced eight seeds* 

The eight seeds from the haploid were sown in the 
greenhouse in September, 19^4-9> anc ^ seven progenies were obtained 
Unfortunately greenhouse conditions were poor during the germin¬ 
ation and tillering periods, and only one spike per plant was

produced. Consequently the chromosome complement could not be 
obtained without eliminating subsequent generations. Of the seven 
plants, only one proved to be completely sterile and it has 
been suggested that high temperatures in the greenhouse during 
the flowering period may have been partially responsible. 

Ten seeds of each of 18 sister plants to the haploid 
were also seeded in the greenhouse in September, 194-9# in progeny 
lines. Six plants in each line were studied cytologically so 
that the chromosome makeup of the immediate parent of the hap¬ 
loid could be determined. 

The F 2 and F^ generations from the haploid were planted 
in progeny lines in the greenhouse in February and June, 1950# 
respectively, only a small percentage of these plants failed to 
survive. Each plant produced several tillers and cytological 
studies of microsporogenisis were made on all plants. 

In this study, all plant material to be examined cyto¬ 
logically was fixed in 6:3:1 Garnoys fluid A, and the acetocarmine 
smear method as outlined by Smith (24) was used for slide prepar¬ 
ations. Chromosome counts were made at a magnification of 600 
diameters and photomicrographs were taken at a magnification of 
either 720 or 900 diameters. The tertiary butyl alcohol method, 
as outlined by Smith (24)# was used for making slides permanent.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND INTERPRETATIONS 


CYTOLOGICAL DATA PROM THE HAPLOID PLANT 


Distribution of Univalent Chromosomes 


In general the chromosomes were distributed through¬ 
out the entire cell at metaphase I, as can be seen in Figs. 1 
and 2. This observation is in agreement with the work of Bleier 
(2), Gaines and Aase (7 ) 9 Ivanov (9), and other workers© Apparent¬ 
ly the univalents did not line up on the plate prior to the first 
anaphase as do normal bivalents. Consequently these two phases 
were not clearly distinguishable# 

A total of 27^ pollen mother cells were counted in 
which the univalents had migrated to the poles. Figs. 4> and 
5* The anaphase I distributions are presented in Table 1.

Cells with near equal distribution occurred with the 
highest frequencies. Actually the 11-10, 12-9, llp-7, 15-6, and 
17— Ij- distribution values were fairly close to the expected values 
for random distribution. Some of the other distributions, how¬ 
ever, deviated very markedly from the expected so that for the 
entire study a highly significant X was obtained. It was quite 
apparent, therefore, that randomness of distribution to the poles 
was restricted. It is interesting that a 20-1 distribution was 
observed in two of the cells studied. Pig. 5# Sears (21), in 
one of his papers, postulated that such a gamete could be one 
possible source of monosomic wheat plants. 


Chromosome Associations 


Paired Chromosomes 

A large number of cells with paired chromosomes were 
observed. True pairing was assumed if a chiasma was actually 
observed. Pig. 6, or if the tapered end appearance of a dis¬ 
joining pair indicated the previous existence of a chiasma. So- 
called secondary pairing was also frequently noted, consisting 
merely of an end-to-end association of univalent chromosomes with 
no sign of a real chiasma. Pig. 2. The data on bivalent and 
other association frequencies are summarized in Table 2.

Of a total of 37$ pollen mother cells counted at 
metaphase I, the greatest proportion (31*0$ and 30 * 1 $) had a 
constitution of 19*1” and 17*2”, respectively. A constitution of 
15>*3 m was observed in 6.1$ of the cells, but no cell was observed 
that had more than three pairs. These frequencies are quite 
different from those reported by Yamasaki (26). 

The cause of bivalent pairing in the haploid could 
have two interpretations. Had the parent of the haploid been 
heterozygous for a number of reciprocal translocations, bivalent 
formation in the haploid could be expected. On the other hand, 
pairing would also occur if there were homology between various 
chromosomes in the haploid* The first hypothesis can be ruled 
out since no ring or chain associations were found in. the progenies 
of the haploid sister plants. All 108 sister progenies proved *to 
be completely normal cytologically. The pairing observed must, 
therefore, be taken as evidence of true homology between certain 
of the haploid chromosomes resulting in the occurrence of recip¬ 
rocal translocations between these chromosomes. If the presence 
of bivalents is a true measure of the number of reciprocal trans¬ 
locations that have taken place, it can be assumed that up to three 
such exchanges have occurred in some cells. It is not suspected 
that this homology was between chromosomes of the same genome, but 
rather between chromosomes of different genomes. Smith (23)

observed a low frequency of bivalents in einkorn haploids which 
have only one genome, and also noted a high correlation between 
the number of bivalents and the number of bridges at anaphase I 
or II* The presence of bridges would suggest that crossing-over 
must have taken place between completely non-homologous chromo¬ 
somes* Since no bridges were observed in this study, and since 
normally disjoining bivalents were frequently noted, it must be 
assumed that pairing occurred between partially homologous chromo¬ 
somes* If the presence of bridges is a true indication of intra¬ 
genome pairing, then their complete absence could indicate equally 
well, inter-genome pairing* 

While mostly open bivalents were observed, a closed 
pair with a chiasma on both sides of the centromere was observed 
in three cells. Pigs. 7 and 8* So far as is known, this has 
never been observed in any of the haploids that have been studied. 
Such complete pairing certainly suggests even greater homology 
between the various chromosomes than has usually been assumed 
to exist* 

Secondary pairing, while frequently observed, is not 
likely an indication of true homology* Possibly as Bleier (2) 
has suggested, stickiness of the chromosomes from prophase on, 
could account for its occurrence* Gene specificity or chemical 
attraction between chromosomes may also be a suitable explanation 
for the formation of secondary pairs*

As mentioned previously, the random distribution of the 
chromosomes at anaphase I, was obviously restricted* Bivalent 
formation and secondary associations were likely responsible for 
disturbing the distributions. Regular disjoining of bivalents 
at anaphase I would alone be restrictive, but also the secondary 
associations remained united going to the same pole, thereby 
further affecting normal distribution* It is, therefore, con¬ 
cluded that distribution was random when 21* were present, but 
that when pairing did occur, distribution was random for only 
those chromosomes not involved in the pairing. 


Chains 

Associations or chains of three to five univalents were 
observed in \\.*%% of the cells. Pig. 9* Apparently a continuation 
of secondary pairing was responsible for this type of chain form¬ 
ation. These associations would likely go to the same pole, there¬ 
by further affecting the randomness of chromosome distribution* 


Cells with Reduplicated Chromosomes

been observed in any of the haploids that have been studied# Pair¬ 
ing was normal and very likely normal gametes would result from such 
a cell# Seven cells were observed that had 1 \2 mostly univalent 
chromosomes. Pig# 11# It is postulated that the first type of 
reduplicated cell could have arisen from failure of cell wall 
formation during the first mitotic division of a sporogenous cell# 
When the nuclei so formed prepared for the second mitotic division, 
a common spindle was formed and the resulting daughter cells (micro- 
sporocytes) would have l\2 chromosomes each# Meiosis would then 
proceed normally. In the second case, cells with l\2 univalents 
could have arisen by cell wall failure in the second mitotic 
division (immediately preceding microsporocyte formation)* Since 
the nuclear membranes in these binucleate cells would remain in¬ 
tact until diakinesis, there would be no opportunity for the l\2 
chromosomes to pair# 

Only five cells contained dyads. Pigs# 12 and 13, which 
were probably formed from a first division split of the univalents, 
remaining joined only at the centromere# In Pig* 12 it can be seen 
that some of the univalents have undergone complete splitting and 
the monads and dyads are being randomly distributed to the poles* 

It is probable that the dyads would undergo a second division but 
the gametes thus formed, would be deficient for several whole 
chromosomes rendering them non-functional*

CYTOLOGICAL DATA PROM THE P 2 AND Fj GENERATIONS 

Since no cytological data are available from the F^ 
plants, all information on the transmission of aberrations had to be 
obtained from the analyses of the F 2 and F 3 populations. The chro¬ 
mosomal constitutions of the F£ and F 3 generations which were cyto- 
logically examined, are presented in Table 3* 

Of the 60 F 2 plants examined, 26 or 4 3 % had a normal 

it 

chromosomal complement of 21, Fig# 15• Of 231 F 3 plants examined, 

153 or 66 % proved to have a normal constitution. Consequently, 
these data indicate that plants with chromosomal aberrations be¬ 
came progressively fewer with succeeding generations# As would be 
expected, all normal F 2 plants had normal progeny# Aberrant plants, 
however, transmitted aberrations to some of their offspring# Further¬ 
more, the aberrations varied markedly in different sister progenies, 
being in some cases more extreme than in the parent. Apparently 
the degree of abnormalness of the parent plant determined the re¬ 
lative frequency of normal and abnormal progeny# 

The most common type of aberrations noted were chains of 
three or four chromosomes, rings of four and univalents. It is 
assumed that these aberrations were largely the result of reciprocal 
translocations that occurred in the haploid# Moreover, the high

frequency of F 2 and F 3 plants containing up to three associations 
of three or four chromosomes, further substantiated the hypothesis 
that up to three reciprocal translocations occurred in the haploid* 
Disjunction from translocation configurations likely caused the 
formation of deficient and duplicated gametes which would result 
in plants having chains and also unpaired chromosomes, especially 
if the interchanged portion were small* A diagramatic represen¬ 
tation of the probable origin of aberrant gametes from one reci¬ 
procal translocation, is presented in Fig* lij_* Random union of any 
two of such gametes, gives numerous possibilities for various types 
of chromosomal aberrations* If as many as three reciprocal trans¬ 
locations were involved, the resulting progeny could have all the 
cytological abnormalities observed in this study. Figs* l 6 to 25># 

It is probable that most male gametes would be normal in chromo¬ 
some number, but occasionally ones with an aneuploid number might 
be functional* Female gametes, on the other hand, would be ex¬ 
pected to transmit aberrations with a fairly high frequency* 

The total number of chromosomes in different fertile 
plants ranged from 39, Fig. l6, to if.7. Fig. 1?« It is surprising 
that fertility and vigor was high even in some of the most aberrant 
plants. The plant with 39 chromosomes appeared quite normal pheno¬ 
typic ally* This is highly interesting since Sears (21) found that 
nullisomics were usually quite weak and sterile* Probably the 39

chromosome plant had certain interchanged chromosomes so that 
there was actually no complete absence of essential genetic 
material* 

The meiotic behaviour of one F^ plant should be 
especially noted. Fig# 26# At metaphase I, it proved to be 
highly asynaptic similar to nulli-3 described by Sears (22). 
It is possible that this plant was nullisomic for chromosome 
three, and the origin of such a plant also can be explained 
from the union of certain gametes, each deficient for the 
same chromosome. Fig. lij.#

CONCLUSIONS 


It is concluded that the pairing observed in the 
haploid occurred between chromosomes because of homology 
rather than translocation heterozygosity 0 This pairing, how¬ 
ever, resulted in reciprocal translocations which gave rise to 
plants in succeeding generations, with various deficiency and 
duplication constitutions* These results are interpreted as 
evidence that there is considerable homology between chromo¬ 
somes of the various genomes in hexaploid wheat* It is highly 
probable, of course, that the actual gene homology and dupli¬ 
cation present in common wheat haploids, is much greater than 
the actual pairing indicated* Pairing would likely occur 
only when considerable portions of chromosomes were identical* 
In the evolution of this species it is likely that many gene 
and chromosome rearrangements have occurred so that while there 
is genetic homology, ther$ is structural homology for meiotic 
pairing in only relatively few haploid chromosomes. 

It is felt that secondary pairing is no indication 
of true chromosomal homology, but that it restricted random 
distribution of the chromosomes to the poles* The same process 
causing s econdary pairing was likely also responsible for the 
formation of chains*

Cells with reduplicated chromosomes were found and it 
is suggested that the process whereby these were formed could 
account for the formation of doubled gametes and seed setting 
in normally sterile hybrids. In the case of the cell with 
21 ”, it is assumed that cell wall formation failed during the 
first mitotic division of the sporogenous cell, while in the 
case of cells with cell wall formation failed in the 

second mitotic division*
