Introduction. 


The god-concept in one form or another is found 
among practically all peoples. It seems to have played 
a vital part in the emergence and development of the 
human race. It is not improbable that the belief in a 
god has been helpful in the development of some traits 
which distinguish the human'from other species of life, 
since strong and abiding human emotions have centred 
about it as their nucleus. 

That the *god-idea^ has been a helpful factor in 
the genesis and development of successive stages of 
human culture is generally believed, but assent is by 
no means unanimous. Some hold that the god-concept may 
have been helpful at a primitive level of culture but 
that mankind has now arrived at a stage of development 
where it may, yea must, rid itself of the belief of a 
God in the interest of free and full self-development of 
individuals sind groups. 

In view of a waning belief in a deity and a 
contemperaneous tendency to disregard customs and laws 
an investigation into the genetic relationship between 
the god-concept and the good life would seem to urge 
itself upon leaders in society. Some hold that the 
belief in a god is a hindrance to progress and it ought 
therefore to be eradicated from the minds of the growing 
generation. Others regard it as a helpful factor in the

development of desirable social attitudes. Hence their 
desire to perpetuate the received conception of God. 

Again others concede the disciplining value of the * god- 
idea* operating in the minds of men, but insist that all 
irrevelant and untenable elements in the conception of 
God, survivals from a by-gone age(^must be eliminated and 
our notion of God must be brought into harmony with what 
is now definitely known about existence in general and 
organic life in particular, fhat naturally raises the 
question as to what is vital and what are merely anachron¬ 
istic survival elements in the god-concept. An inquiry 
into the origin, the development, the nature and function 
of the gods would therefore seem to be very timely. To 
trace the development of the god-concept as elaborated 
in the ’Voelkerpsychologie* of Wilhelm Wuhdt,r, and to 
discover, as far as possible, the laws that underlie 
such development, is the task which we have set ourselves 
in this essay.

Chapter One; Develoioment of a Scientific Method of 


Tnauiry Into the Orifrin ajid Development of the God-concept, 

God has not ceased to be a vital issue among 
men. True, ours is an age of scientific knowledge rather 
than of religious faith. It is true also that partici¬ 
pation in religious assemblages, religious rites and 
ceremonies, ’on God's Day, in God’s house, with God’s 
people' appears to be on the wane, for the time being 
at least, in our Western world. Whether as cause or as 
effect, or merely as a parallel phenomenon we shall not 
now try to determine, but certain it is that also the 
conscientious observance of the 'will and la?; of God’ is . 

on the wane. Again, V'/hether as cause or effect or mere¬ 
ly as a parallel phenom.enon we shall not attempt to say, 
but it is an observance which has proven quite disturbing 
not only to church leaders and parents but also to those 
charged Y/ith the enforcement of law and the m.aintenajice 
of order and those entrusted v^ith the preservation of 
reasona^ble security of property and life, that the laws 
of mian are being more and more side-stepped if not . 
transgressed. 

Som-e regard the waning belief in God as a mark- 


of progress. Others interpret it as an indication of 
retrogression. Some think that the' elimination of God 
from the problems and a.ffairs of men is a harbinger of 











an age of enlightenment. Others hold that it presages 
another Dark Age, ?/e shall not now attempt to evaluate 
the utility of a belief in God. We Vi/ould merely observe 
thatjthe indications of a waning God-belief notwith¬ 
standing, faith in God of some kind is still very general. 
Few have the courage to eliminate God entirely from 
their conscious life. Even they who at an age when 
their own ego-feeling is particularly exuberant make 
bold to defy God, often come upon times when they 
silently creep back into the shelter of a gracious and 
helping God. 

It is true of course that a person having a 
precise ‘knowledge* of God such as found in theology 
is a 'rara avis*. It is also true that not only the 

enrollments at theological institutions are down but 

\ . 

that there is less emphasis on the study of theology 
proper than in an age that has gone by. Popular con¬ 
ceptions of God are increasingly vague if existant at 

^ ' ' 

all. All of which means that gullibility in matters 
religious is on the increase. Having no confidence in 
their own knowledge of God they are open to suggestions 
that border^on the absurd in matters pertaining to God. 

The multiplicity of new sects would appear to be evidence 
for this assertion. 

Furthermore, in those circles of religious 











3 


thinking where ’the faith once delivered unto the 
saints’ still holds sway some elements in the conception 
of God are being retained which tend to make the God of 
the Fundamentalists a 'persona non grata' among persons 
who have some claim to membership in the intellectual 
and moral aristocracy of our age. And certainly, even 
uhe •fundamentalists have some justification for asking 
that an objective investigation be made into the nature 
of ’saints’ as they are found, believed in, and adored 
in other than Protestant communions of the Christian 
Church. Again, we of the Western world are curious to 
know how pagan peoples arrived at a conception of god 
Y/ho is ugly and hideous beyond description in his out- 
Y\/ard appearance as Y^ell as in his moral attitudes. 

An investigation, frank and fearless, into 
the origin and nature of prevailing god-concepts would 
seem to be desirable and necessar^r especially since we 
have discovered that we are living in a changing \Yorld. 
For^ if v;e live in a changing worldthe probability 
would seem to be that Y/e have need of changing our con¬ 
ception of those tangible and intangible entites which 
we consider of value to our individual and social well¬ 
being. Among other things, som.e elements in our con¬ 
ception of God which at one time were believed to be, 
and perhaps actually were, vital and essential, may 









4 


today have become non-essential not to say harmful euid 
anti-social. A changing world would appear to make a 
re-interpretation of our inrierited symbols, religious 
and otherv/ise, indispensible. Progress in the exact 
sciences having made it imperative for the astrologer 
to make some readjustments in his conception of the 
universe, v7ho will say that worshippers and theologians 
are not under a similar obligation to re-orient them- 
selves and modify their conceotions of God? And the 
idea that we are indeed living in a changing world appears 
to have very gradually but nevertheless very certainly 
established itself in the mind of maji. 

The concept of ’change’ has established itself 
slowly and gradually in the mind of man. From a con¬ 
templation of water, Thales of Miletus, on the shores of 
Asia Minor, back in 585 EG., drew the conclusion that 
mobility was characteristic of all forms of existence. 
Heracleitus, of Ephesus, developed the idea of fluidity 
in all existence and gave man the phrase ’panta rei’• 

’’You could not step twice in the same rivers; for 
other and yet other v^aters are ever flov/ing on,” 
Fragments-41-42. 

Though Xenophanes is listed with those of 
Platonic, or better, pre-Platonic, tendencies, he never¬ 
theless was among the first to see the necessity and 
importance of purifying the conception of God in keeping

with progress of scientific knowledge and in harmony 
with the grov;th in ethical consciousness. His investi¬ 
gation into the origin and nature of the gods led him 
to say among other things: 

“Homer and Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all 
things that are a shame and a disgrace among men, 
thefts and adulteries and deceptions of one an¬ 
other. —But mortals think that the gods are born 
as they are, and have perceptions like theirs and 
voice and form. Yes, and if oxen and lions had 
hands, and could paint with their hands and produce 
works of art as men do, horses w’ould paint the 
forms of the gods like horses, and oxen like oxen. 
Each would represent them with bodies according 
to the form of each, *—So the Ethiopians make 
their gods black and snub-nosed; the Thracians 
give theirs red hair and blue eyes," L 

The critical attitude of Democritus, 
Aristophanes and other Sophists, continued to foster 
the spirit of inquiry, inquiry also into the origin and 
nature of received god-ideas. That 'man is the measure 
of all things’ and that therefore also the conception 
of God must chajige as man desires it is an idea against 
which Plato protested, Plato still supplies fuel for 
the fire of religious conservatism. However, even 
though they who 'believe in nothing but wHat they can 
hold fast in their hands’ have been, and»perhaps, 

" 5 . 

are still, by students of Plato, regarded as Barbarians, 
the men v/ho are skeptical about the existence of pre¬ 
existent, eternal, unchanging forms and ideas' have con¬ 
tinued the spirit of free inquiry into the origin, 

history, and essential qualities of all existence and

also that of the gods, Aristotle, though widely used 
by the conservatives to maintain their untouchable 
status, has nevertheless given the inductive method of 
inciuiry a m.ighty impetus, 

Christ marks the beginning of a new epoch in 
the history of the concept of God, The Fatherhood of 
God dates from that era, Christ made bold to reinter¬ 
pret God, Dionysian enthusiasm and mysticism, even as 
mysticism at all tim.es, has provided an atmosphere 
favorable to the free inquiry into the nature of God, 
During the so-called Dark Ages a 'successful’ and well- 

unified Church prevented anv inquiry whatsoever, least 

1 

of all into the nature of God. Says Will Durant 

"The Church, supported in its earlier centuries by 
the emperors whose powers it gradually absorbed, 
grew rapidly in numbers, wealth and range of in¬ 
fluence, By the thirteenth century it owned one- 
third of the soil of Europe, and its coffers 
bulged with donations of rich and poor. For a 
thousand years it united, with the magic of an 
unvarying creed, m.ost of the peoples of the con¬ 
tinent; never before was organization so wide¬ 
spread 0 Jid so pacific. But this unity demanded, 
as the Church thought, a comjnon faith exalted by 
supernatural sanctions beyond the changes and 
corrosions of time; therefore dogma, definite and 
defined, was cast like a shell over the adolescent 
mind of Mediaeval Europe, It was v^ithin this 
shell that Scholasticism moved narrov/ly from faith 
to reason and back again, in a b8.ffling circuit 
of uncriticized assumptions a-nd preordanied con¬ 
clusions," 

The Crusades tended to vjiden the mental horizon 
of Western Europeans. The fall of Constantinople in

1453 brought Eastern learning and the key to the 
treasures of Greece into Italy and through Italy into 
Germany and England. With the opening of these trea¬ 
sures came the rebirth of the Spirit of Greece, the 
spirit of free inquiry. The Reformation, en\9iiating 
from Wittenberg in Germany and from Geneva are the 
fruits of a new ino^uiry into the nature of God. 

Admittedly it was Francis Bacon v/ho 'rang 
the bell that called the v/its. together' . Bacon, at 
the threshold of modern philosophy, gave us the analogy 
of the bee which, unlike the ant which only heaps up 
and stores away, and unlike the spider which spins out 
his own web, gathers m.aterials from the gardens and the 
fields and produces therev/ith somiething sweet and orderly 
By giving the world the modern method of research by 
postulating that only those concepts are reasonably 
valid V'/hich have been arrived at by the inductive method, 
Bacon gave a mighty im-petus to the late inquiry into the 
origin and nature of religious concepts, including that 
of the god”concept. Bacon did not have the courage to 
carry the method v;hich is commonly associated with his 
narnie into the religious field, but he did provide the 
technique for later scientific investigations. As to 
the scientific method of inquiring into the origin , 
nature and validity of the god-concept Bacon wrote: 







8 


'•If am^ man shall think by view and ino^uiry into 
sensible and material things to attain to any light 
for the revelation of the nature and will of God, 
he shall dangerously abuse himself. It is true 
that the contemplation of the creatures of God hath 
for end, as to the natures of the creatures them- 
selves, knowledge, but, as to the nature of God, 
no knowledge, but wonder, which is nothing else but 
contemplation broken off or losing itself. Nay, 
further, as it was aptly said by one of Plato's 
scnool, the sense of man resembles the sun, which 
openeth and revealeth the terrestrial globe, but 
obscureth and concealeth the celestial; so doth 
the sense discover natural things, but darken and 
shut up divine." 1 

Bacon did indeed break the Idols of the Tribe, 
the Idols of the Cave, the Idols of the Market Place and 
the Idols of the Theatre* His iconoclasm was directed, 
hoY^ever, not chiefly against religious idols but against 
intellectual fallacies* 

"Theories and opinions and common notions, so far 
as can be obtained from, the stiffness and firm^ness 
of the mind, should be entirely done a-^ay ?/ith and 
the understanding should begin anew, plainly and 
fairly with particulars, since there is no other 
entrance open to the kingdom of nature than to the 
kingdom of heaven, into which no one may enter 
except in the form of a little child." 

Thus did Bacon help to jpave the way for in¬ 
vestigations into the origin and nature of religious 

concepts undertaken several hundred years later by such

host of others, including V/. V/undt. Bacon must be re~ 
garded as one v/ho helped to sov/ the seed out of which 
grev; the first institute for experimental psychology 
at Leipsic in 3.874, and as one who helped to inspire 
the m.oniimental collection and i.nterpretation of data 
bearing on the development of religious practices and 
concents as fo' nd in the "Voelkerpsvcholocrie“ . 

In the middle of the 17th century, BaruCxU 
(Benedict) Spinoza, called the ^*most impious atheist 
that ever lived upon the face of the earth'*, suffered 
as a martyr for daring to inquire into the nature of 
God, He v^as maligned and persecuted for saying;2 

talce a totally different view of God and Hature 
from that which the later Christians usually 
entertain, for I hold that God is the immanent, 
and not the extraneous cause of all things, I sa^^: 
All is in God; all lives and moves in God,** 

Any suggestion that God is not like man (anti- 

anthropo.morphism) is usual]-y met with emotionally 

coloured opposition on the part of the average m.an, and 

hence the development of the empirical method of inquiry 

into the origin and na,ture of God has been slow ajid m.et 

with much opposition. All of which suggests that man*s 

conception of God, of vjhatever nature it may be, is to

him a treasury of his most valued possessions. God 
harbours those things which man considers most vital to 
his well-being here and a supposed hereafter. Spinoza 

1 

no doubt was hated by Jev;« and Gentiles alike for Vt/riting: 

’♦V/hen you say that if I allow not in God the opera¬ 
tions of seeing, hearing, observing, willing and 
the like—you know not what sort of God mine is, 

I thence conjecture that you believe there is no 
greater perfection than such as can be explained 
by the attributes aforesaid. I do not wonder at 
it; for I believe that a triangle, if it could 
speak, would in like manner say that God is 
eminently triangular, and a circle that the divine 
nature is eminently circular; and thus would every¬ 
one ascribe his own attributes to God." 

John Locke, 1632-1704, considered it an honour * to 

be employed as an under-labourer in clearing the ground 

a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in 

2 

the way to knowledge *. "To break in upon the sanctuary 
of vanity and ignorance will be, I suppose, some service 
to human understanding", said Locke, and by giving the 
world his Essay on the Human Undepstanding (1690) and 
with it the * tabula-rasa’ concept of the human mind, 
he did much to open the windows and allow the spirit of 
free and unbiased inquiry into the nature of iniierited 
conceptions of God to stimulate the minds of men. 

Hume’s "Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding” not only 
aroused Immanuel Kant from his dogmatic slumber

but continues, Berkeley, Kant and Hegel notv^ithstanding, 
to inspire students in all parts of,the world to go in 
quest of *quaecumque vera* v^/ith at least a minimum of 
inhibition from received prejudices and pre-conceived 
notions* 

Neither Rousseau, by lifting the God-concept 
out of the realm of reason and hiding it in the inner 
recesses of feeling, nor Kant by placing it into the 
realm of faith, thinking it to be immine there from 
attacks by the skepticism of Hume, could permanently 
prevent men from inquiring into -the nature of God* 

Among the iconoclasts of the 18th century, in the Age 
of Enlightenment and ’Aufklaerung’, Voltaire takes 
first rank for boldness and lucidity. As the discovery 
and use of gun powder gave the common people a glimpse 
of the interior of castles, so the invention of the 
printing press, from, the days of Gutenberg aJid William 
Caxton up to the days of Voltaire, gave the ordinary man 
a glimpse of the treasures that lie hidden behind words* 
Of course, there was more ferocity than quiet, patient, 
scholarly inquiry in the v^ritings of men of Voltaire’s 
type* The Enlightenment represents a furious and bar¬ 
barian attempt to eradicate the God-idea from the minds 
of men, rather than an intelligent attempt to understand 
and evaluate the origin and nature of gods* Said Baron

d' Holbach: 

’*If we go back to the beginning we shall find that 
ignorance and fear created the gods, that fancy, 
enthusiasm or deceit adorned or disfigured them, 
that weakness worships them; that credulity pre¬ 
serves them; and that custom respects and tyranny 
supports them in order to make the blindness of 
men serve its own interests—■ Men will never be 
free till the last king is strangled with the en¬ 
trails of the last priest,” 

Com-te was willing- to admit g*od back into his 
^Religion of Humanity’ provided of course that he agreed 
to become thoroughly ’humanized’* The most important 
step in the development of a scientific m.ethod of enquiry 
into the origin and nature of the god-concept came during 
the middle of the 19th century. Having passed through 
a long period of ferm.entation in the minds of thinkers 
from Thales to Spencer, the concept of ’evolution’ found 
its fullest expression in Darwin’s epoch-m.aking ’’Origin 
of Species", published in 1859, With the development 
of the idea of evolution in the field of biology, a 
long range view was introduced into the study of all 
sciences. When Spencer postulated that 'life is a con¬ 
tinuous adjustment of internal relations to external 
relations’ he threw a new ray of light not only on the 
essential tendency of organic physical life but also on 
the origin and tendency of spiritual entities* The idea 
of increasing integration accompanied by increasing 
heterogenity v;as later on to shed light on the possible

origin and cause for the development of a monotheistic 
conception of God, Spencer's "Principles of Sociology" 
initiated a long series of com.prehensive inquiries into 
the origin of social institutions, customs and beliefs. 

The study of *god’, if not of theology, was resumed 
with nev/ seal. 

One of the first steps toward an appreciation 
of Wundt's "Voelkerpsychologie" is to remem-ber that not 
only Locke and Hume but also Darwin and Spencer had pre¬ 
ceded nim. 

The development of a school of 'Higher 
Criticism.' , chiefly in Germany, a movement in which such 
names as Graf, Wellhausen, Ha.rnack and Baur, stand out 
prominently, in which the sacred writings of the Christian 
Church were subjected to a new interpretation, was un¬ 
doubtedly also a fruition, in part, of the discovery 
of the evolutionary concept. 

The avowed purpose of some writers who have 
brought frank thinking to bear on religious concepts 
has been to eradicate god-concepts and to eliminate God 
from the lives of humans. The purpose of the more 
really scholarly section of investigators, hov/ever, has been 
not so much to nullify as to purify, not to eradicate 
but to elevate the conception that m*en have of God, 

The true scholars, of course, have not considered 
possible effects and outcomes of their investigations

at all. In a manner that becomes a true scientist 
they have tried, vyithout prejudice or preconceived notions 
without having an axe to grind, to get to the bottom 
of the problems which we indicated at the beginning of 
our essay. Strangely enough, there is not yet any great 
unanimity among; those who have looked into the matter. 

This has again raised the question of the validity of 
the method which proved so fruitful in the physical 
sciences when applied to the problems of psychology> 
and sociology.

Chapter Tv/o; Various Hypotheses on the Development of 

the God-concept and Wundt’s Criticism of 

Theories on the origin of the .eods have been 

CP 

classified, as theories of degeneration and theories of 

development 5 pre-Darwinian and post-Darwinian. 

**At first glance it may seem presumptuous even to 
raise the question as to how gods originated. 

Have they not always existed? one is inclined to 
ask. As a matter of fact, this is the opinion of 
most historians, particularly of historians of 
religion. They hold that the belief in gods is 
underived. Degenerate forms may arise, the belief 
may at times disappear altogether or be displaced 
by a crude belief in magic and demons, but it 
itself can in no wise have developed from anything 
else, for it was possessed by mankind from the very 
beeinning.*’ 1 

Wundt criticizes the theory of original mono¬ 
theism on the ground that many nature peoples have 


no conception of a god at all, 

’’Were it true that the uelief in gods represents 
an original possession of mankind, our question 
concerning the origin of gods would be invalidated. 
The assum.ption, however, is disproved by the facts 
of ethnology. There are peoples without gods. 

True, there are no people without some sort of 
supersensuous beings; nevertheless, to call all 
such beings ’gods'- beings for examrole, such as 
sickness-dem.ons or dem.ons which threaten the corpse 
and threaten the living - would appear to be a 
v7holly unv^arranted extension of the conception 
of deity. Unbiased observation goes to show that 
there are no people without certain conceptions 
that m.ay be egarded as precursors of the later 
goc-ideas, Nevertheless, there can be no doubt 
that there a.re some people v^ithout gods. The Vedahs

of Ceylon, the so-called nature-Semangs and Senoi 
of Malacca, the natives of A.ustralia, and many 
other peoples of nature as v;ell, possess no gods, 
in our sense of the Y/ord. Because all of these 
primitive peoples interpret certain natural phenomena 
such as clouds, winds, and stars, in an anthropo¬ 
morphic fasixion, it has been a.ttempted time and 
again to establish the presence of the god-idea 
of higher religions. Such attem.pts, however, may 
be straightway characterised as a play \cith super¬ 
ficial analogies in which no thought whatsoever 1 
is ta.ken of the real content of the .god-concept ion/’ 

That there is, and al^/ays has been, a universal 
belief in one Supreme God, and that ideas of spirits, 
ghosts, and a host of other imseen beings are but degen¬ 
erated forms of that original monotheistic god-idea, 
v^as the rather generally accepted belief in pre-Darv/inian 
days. The hypothesis is still defended by m.en who have 

claim to scholarship. It is obviously taken for granted 

2 

by the Genesis record of origins; 

”In the beginning God created the heaven and the 
earth. And the earth was without form and void; 
and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And 
the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,” 

The originality of the one-god idea is equally 

definitely stated in the epilogue to the Gosoel according 
3 

to John: 

”Tni the beginning was the Word, and the Word was 
with God, and the Word was God, The same was in 
the beginning with God, All things were made by 
Kim* and without Him was not a-nvthiner m*ade that 
wax made,” 

God as the Invisible Creator of the Visible 

Universe and as the Author of the accepted code of morals ..

is believed by some investigato'^s to have been a form 
of the belief in God held by even the most primitive 
peoples. 

1 

According to the m.onotheistic hypothesis 

’’the deity had from the very beginning the character 
of a personal, high Being, conceived as the Creator 
of the world or at least of mankind and as the 
Originator of moral norms. Though the defenders 
of this hypothesis admit that on the lowest strata 
of culture this conception of God is still cruae 
and imperfect, yet they hold that it does exist 
and that all the essential attributes of the God 
of later monotheistic religions are to be found 
even at the earliest stage of development. A 
development of the god~concept within these limits 
is therefore admitted; but development is held 
to be possible onl^^ in as far as these originally 
present attributes, representing religious and 
ethical values, admit of intensification.'' 

The commonly accepted thesis about the origin 
and history of the God-concept is explicitly stated in 
Paul’s letter to the Hom.ans. 

Speaking of the god-concepts of Gentiles, 

2 

Greeks and Barabarians, St. Pa.ul declares j 

’’Because that which may be knovm of God is manifest 
in them; for God hath showed it unto them. For 
the invisible thinms of Him from the creation of 
the world are clearly seen, being understood by 
the things that are made; even His eternal power 
and Godhead; so that they are without excuse, be¬ 
cause that v/hen they knew God, they glorified Him 
not"as God, neither were thankful; but became vain 
in their imaginations, and their foolish heart 
was darkened. Professing themselves to be w'^se, 
they became as fools, and changed the glory 
of the uncorruptible God into an image made like 
to corruptible man, and to birds and four-footed

beasts, and creeping things, V^herefore God also 
gave 1 hem up to uncleanness, through the lusts of 
their own hearts, to dishonour their own body 
between themselves; who changed the truth of God 
into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature 
more than the Creator, v;ho is blessed forever. 

For this cause God gave them, up to vile affections. 
For even their v/omen did change the natural use 
into that which is against nature: and likewise 
also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, 
burned in their lust one toward -another; men with 
men working that which is unseemly, and receiving 
■‘n themselves that recompense of their error which 
was meet. And even as they did not like to retain 
God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a 
reprobate mind, to do those things which are not 
convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, 
fornication, wickedness, covetousness, malicious¬ 
ness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malig¬ 
nity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, 
despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil 
things, disobedient to parents, without understand¬ 
ing, covenant-breakers5 without natural affection, 
implacable, unmerciful,^’ 

Vsfe quoted this section from Paul's Letter to 
the Romans in full because it is the classic presentation 
not only of an original and pure monotheistic god- 
concept but also because it presents one aspect of the 
problem which is usually associated with this thesis, 
namely that a hieh ethical standard v/as from the be- 
ginning a part of that original conception of God. One 
would need to go far to find a more classic presentation 
of the so-called ’degeneration’ theory, 

Am.ong the men who have in more recent years 
tried to rescue this thesis and defend it are two part¬ 
icularly, both of v;hom have very considerable claim on 







19 


a scholarly attitude and have investiga.ted and re¬ 
examined the problem in the light of exhaustive material 
gathered by anthropologists and ethnographers• Theyaare 
F. Max JTueller and Andrew Lang. 

Max Mueller was for many yea.rs professor of 
philology at Oxford University. His special field of 
inquiry v>/as that of language. In. Sanskrit he believed 
that he had found original elements of language comjiaon 
to all Indo-Germanic peoples. In two series of lectures 
Gifford Lectures, in 1890 and 1898, he presented at con¬ 
siderable length his thesis of a natural development of 
religious concepts, common to all peoples. It would 
not be fair to say that Mueller defends the orthodox 
'degeneration theory’. He laboured nearly fifty years 
after "the Origin of Species” appeared (1859) and he 
firmly resents any suggestion that he entertains pre- 
Darwinian concepts of history. Indeed, he vigourously 
insists that philology argued for progressive develop¬ 
ment long before Darv/in appeared on the scene. Basing 
his hypot-hesis on evidences taken from a 'praethnische 
Ursprache’, an ’or indogermanische Quelle' he posits a 
natural development of the one-god idea common to all 
peoples. 

A study of the ancient religions of the world, 
and more particularly of the earliest religion of India, 
teaches us first of all, that m.any things in nature

which we are now inclined to treat as natural, as a 
matter of course, appeared to the minds of the earliest 
oDservers in a much truer light as by no means natural, 
as by no means a matter of course, but on the contrary 
as terrific, as astounding, as truly miraculous, as 
supernatural. It was in these very phenomena of nature, 
the sky, the sun, the fire, and the storm-v^ind, which to 
us seem so natural, so ordinary, so hackneyed, that- man 
perceived for the first time something that startled 
him out of his animal torpor, that made him ask: ^i^/hat 
is it? What does it all mean? Whence does it all come? 

~ that forced him, whether he liked it or not, to look 
behind the drama of nature for actors or agents, agents 
whom in his language and thought he called superhuman, 
and, 3h the end, divine. We must not imagine that 
these.early observers and namers of nature did not 
distinguish between these phenomena, as.mere phenomena, 
and the agents postulated by their very language. The 
names given to these phenomena were in reality the names 
noumena, of unseen powers. Zeus, and Jupiter, and 
Dyaush pita in Sanskrit were not meant for the dead sky; 
they v/ere names at all events in the beginning, of an. 
agent within or behind or beyond the sky. They were 
masculine names, not neuters. They represent, as I 
tried to show, the first a,ttempt at grasping that Infinite 
which underlies all our finite perceptions, and at naming

the Supernatural, as manifested in the Natural. They 
are the first steps v/hich led in the end to a faith in 
God, as revealed in Nature. V/hat I chiefly wished to 
establish by means of the evidence so unexpectedly sup¬ 
plied to us in the hym.ns of the Rig-veda was the sim¬ 
plicity and almost necessity of the Physical Religion, 
or of the discovery of God in nature* Given man, such 
as he 'is, not, of course as a tabula rasa, but as en¬ 
dowed with reason and language, and armed with the so- 
called categories of the understanding; and given nature, 
such as it is, not as a chaos, but as a text that can be 
construed, v\?hat we call Physical Religion, a naming of 
and believing in Agents behind the great drama of nature, 
was inevitable, ajod, being inevitable, was, for the tims 
being, true. But it was true as a first step only in 
an unbroken chain of intellectual evolution, for it vjas 
soon recognized that these various agents were really 
doing one and the sarnie work, whether their presence w/as 
perceived in the sky, or in the sum, or in the fire, 

.or in the storm wind. Hence the various names of these 
agents, the Devas or the Bright ones, as they were 
called, were recognized after a tim.e by the more thought¬ 
ful poets, SB names of one all-powerful Agent, no longer 
a mere Deva by the side of other Devas, but the Lord, 
the Lord of all created things, hence called Praggapati, 
the universal V/ill, hence called Brahma, and, in the end,

of the v7orld teach us that 


“all reli^-ions spring from the same soil, the human 
heart, that they all look to the sajne ideals, and 
that they are all surrounded by the same dangers 
and difficulties. Much that is represented to us 
a^ supernatural in the 8.nnals of ancient religions 
of the world becom.es perfectly natural from this 
point of view,“

"V'/e speak of the god of the sky, or of the wind, or 
of the :"’ain. But you will see that in the Veda 
we can watch this god of fire long before he is a 
god at all; and, on the other hand, we shall be able 
to trace his further growth till he is no longer 
a god of fire merely, but a supreme god, a god 
above all other gods, a creator and ruler of the 
world. In fact we shall learn from this one instance 
the authentic history of that long psychological j: 

process, which beginning with the simplest and 
purely material perceptions hAi led the human m.ind 
to that highest concept of deity v/hich we have in¬ 
herited together 'with our language, as members of 
the great Aryan, and not of the Semitic family,” 

Andrew Lang, too, is classified by Vi/undt.. v^ith 


those who defend an original monotheism. In “The Makirg 


of Religion" (1898) Lang m.akes a very spirited attack 

on the ’animistic’ hypothesis of the origin of the 
3 

god-concept, 


“V/e wish to show that the idea of God, as he is

conceived by our inquiring plain man, is shadov(/ed 
forth (among contraaictory fables) in the lowest 
' known mracie of savagery, and therefore cannot arise 
from the later speculation of men, comparatively 
civilized and advanced, on the original datum of 
ghosts. We shall demonstrate, contrary to the 
opinion of Mr* Spencer, Mr. Huxley, and even Mr. 
Tylor, that the Supreme Being, and, in one case 
at least, the casual sprites of savage faith, are 
active moral influences. What is even m.ore im^portant 
we shall m.ake it undeniable that Anthropology has 
simplified her problem by neglecting or ignoring 
her facts,” The Anthropologists have evaded the 
issue. 

”The real crux is the evolution of the idea (always 
obscured by mytholog 3 ^) of a .moral, uncreated, 
undying God among the lov/est savages. The negli¬ 
gence of anthropologists has arisen from a single 
circumstance. They take it for granted that God 
is always regarded a.s a Spirit. Having accounted 
for the development of the idea of spirit, they 
regard God as that idea carried to its highest 
power, and- as the final step in its evolution. 

But, if we can show that the earl^^ idea of an un¬ 
dying, moral.creative being does not necessarily 
or logically impl^“ the doctrine of spirit (or 
ghost) then this idea of an eternal, moral, creative 
being may have existed even before the doctrine 
of spirit v;as evolved,-—We want to know hOY7 Gods, 
makers of things, fathers in heaven, and friends, 
guardians of morality, seeing what is good or bad 
in the hearts of men, were evolved, as is supposed, 
out of ghosts or surviving souls of the dead. 

That such moral, pra.ctically omniscient Gods are 
known to the very lowest of savageS'—Bushmen, 

Fuegians, Australians—we shall demonstrate." 

The idea that gods^ as ethical beings develop 

/vit-x the ethical and social growth of peoples is not 

1 

admitted by Lang,

(Hoeffding) is quite generally accepted. Lang, 
however declares: "Here the inquirer must be 
careful not to adopt the common opinion that Gods 
improve, morally and otherwise, in direct ratio 
to the rising grades in the evolution and culture 
and civilization. That is not necessarily the case; 
usually the reverse occurs. Still less must we 
take it for granted, following Mr. Tylor and Mr. 
Huxley, that the alliance (of morality and religion) 
belongs almost, or wholly, to religions above the 
savage level, not to the earlier and lower creeds; 

or that among the Australian savages and in its 
simplest condition, theology is wholly independent 
of ethics. These statements can be proved (by such 
evidence as anthropology is obliged to rely upon) 
to be erroneous, -^^nd, just because these statements • 
are put forward, -Anthropology has an easier task 
of explaining the origin of religion; while, just 
because these statements are incorrect, her conclusion! 
being deduced from premises so far Mase, is in- I 

validated*'^ 

Lang believes that anthropologists have selected j 

I 

their data in the interest of maintaining a pre-conceived ' 
1 

thesis. 

"Anthropology, while fixing her gaze on totems, 
on worshipped mumjnies, adored ghosts, and treasured 
fetishes, has not,to my knowledge, made a compara¬ 
tive study of the higher and purer religious ideas 
of savages." 

♦^The evidence is the best attainable, and it seems 
proved beyond doubt that savages have ^felt after* 
a conception of a creator much higher than that for 
which they commonly get credit. Now, if that con¬ 
ception is original, or is very early (and nothing 
in it suggests lateness of development) then the 
other elements of their faith and practice are 
degenerate." 

Lang accounts psychologically for the degenera¬ 
tion hypothesis.

"How could, all mankind forget a pure relig:ion?“ 

That degeneration T would account for b;'- the 4t- 
trations which animism, when once developed, 
possessed for the naughty natural man, *the old 
Adam*’ A moral Creator, in need of no gifts, and 
opposed to lust and mischief, will not help a man 
..ith love-spells, or with malevolent ’sendings' 
of diseases by witchcraft; will not favour one man 
above his neighbor, or one tribe above its rivals, 
as a reward for sacrifice which he does not accept, 
or as constrained by charms which do not touch his 
omnipotence* Ghosts and ghost-gods on the other 
hand, in need of food and blood, afraid of,spells 
and binding charm.s, are a corrupt, but, to man, 
a useful constituency* Man being v/hat he is, man 
was certain ‘to go a-whoring' after practically 
useful ghosts, ghost-gods and fetishes vjhich he 
could keep in his wallet or mndicine bag* For 
these he was sure, in the long run, first to neg¬ 
lect his idea of his Creator; next, perhaps, to 
reckon him as only one, if the highest, of the venal 
rabble of spirits or deities, and to sacrifice to 
Him as to them. And this is exactly what happenedi 
If we are not to call it degeneration, wha.t are we 
to call it? It may be an old theory, but facts 
’winna ding’, and are on the side of the old theory” 

As culture advanced on the material plane, as 
the crafts and arts arose, each required a special 
protective god. This resulted in the continuance of 
the worship of ’The Unknown God’ with a comparatively 
high standard of ethics, alongside of many degenerate 
gods. 


"At this stage of culture, the luck of the state, 
and fhe interests of a rich and powerful clergy, 
were i.nvolved in the maintenance of the old, 
animistic, relatively non-moral system, as in 
Cuzco, Greece and Rome, That pojjular and political 
regard for the state, that priestly self-interest 
(quite natural), could only be sw'ept away by the 
moral monotheism of Christianity of Islam. Nothing 
else could do it," 1

form of an original pure and ethically high monotheism* 

*^It is undeniable that Jehovah, at a certain 
period of Hebrew history, had become degraded 
and anthropomorphised, far below Darumulun, and 
Puluga, and Pachachamac, and Ahone, as conceived 
of in their purest form. —Even the Big Black 
Man of the Fuegians is on^“-higher level (as 
we reckon morals), when he forbids the slaying 
of the robber enemy, than certain examples of 
early Hebrew conduct. ■—Again, traces of human 
sacrifice appear in the ritual of Israel, and 
it is only relatively late that the great pro¬ 
phets, justly declaring Jehovah to be indif¬ 
ferent to the blood of bulls and rams, try to 
bring back his service to that of the unpro¬ 
pitiated, unbought Dendid, or Ahone, or Pund- 
jel. Here is degeneration, even in Israel-. 

How the conception of Jehovah arose in Israel, 
whether it was a revival of a half-obliterated 
idea, such as we find among low savages; or 
whether it was borrowed from some foreign 
creed; or was the result of meditation on the 
philosophical Supreme Being of high Egyptian 
theology, is another question. The Biblical 
statement leans to the first alternative. 
Jehovah, not by that name, has been the god 
of Israel *^s fatiiersT 

Thus animism represents not an early stage 
in the development of the human mind but a late and 
a degenerate form of it. An ethical monotheism such 
as revived by the prophets of Israel, how orginally 

2 4 

attained "we do not know", originally devoid^of any 
particular interest in the welfare of the soul, ’in 
somewhat of man that may survive the grave’, later

receiving into itself elements of animism, is here 
postulated to have been the original form of a belief 
in God. 

Lang helds that the monotheistic hypothesis 

is not inconsistent with evolutionary hypothesis nor 

1 

with the findings of anthropology. 

"Christianity, last, combined what was good 
in Animism, the care for the individual soul 
as an immortal spirit under eternal respon¬ 
sibilities, with the One Righteous Eternal of 
prophetic Israel, and so ended the long intri¬ 
cate, and mysterious theological education of 
humanity. Such is our theory which does not 
appear, to us, to lack evidence, nor to be 
inconsistent (as the anthropological theory 
is apparently inconsistent) vidth the hypothesis 
of evolution." 

It is strange-that in the discussion and 
solution of a problem which perhaps least of all 
Lends itself to final and dogmatic assertions men 
lave in the past tended to become most dogmatic and 
final. Out of that dogmatic :attitude has-grown the 
s.pirit of intolerance and persecution, it is worth¬ 
while noting that Lang, even as W* Wundt as we shall 
note later, are willing to have their hypothesis re¬ 
garded as such and do not insist on having said the 
hast word in the matter. 

"All this, it must be emphatically insisted 
on, is propounded under all reserves. While 
these four stagey, sayl) the Australian un- 
unpropitiated Moral Being, 2) the African 
neglected Being, still somewhat as in Poly¬ 
nesia, and $) the moral Being reinstated

philosophically, or in Israel, do suggest steps 
in evolution, we desire to base no hard and 
fast system of ascending and descending degrees 
upon our present light, as well as in the light 
thrown by the anthropological theory, in the 
hands whether or Mr, Tylor, Mr. Spencer, M, 
■Seville, or Mr, Jevons, whoi interesting work» 
comes nearest to our provisional hypothesis. 

We only ask for suspension of judgment, and 
for hesitation in accepting the dogmas of modern 
manual-makers,”1 

V/undt admits that Lang has made out a fairly 
good case for an original, common to all, monotheistic 
concept of God, He grants that Langes early affiliation 
with the animistic hypothesis tends to kiake him a v;orthy 
exponent of an hypothesis to which he came in preference 
to the animistic theory. 

^According to Lang the god-idea cannot have been 
derived from elements of animism, because all 
the sources of animistic beliefs death, dreams, 
visions, have nothing in common" with the god- 
idea. Heitner has it anything in common with 
the ghosts and demons. God as the Creator and 
Author of the code of ethics, is conceived by 
most primitive peoples. According to Lang there 
is no fundamental difference- between a ^nature’ 
and a ^culture* people,** 

The question arises: How did the elements 

of this god-concept pass from one nation to another? 

**Lang attempts to account for this thesis by 
citing a great number of primitive peoples \Nho 
are thought to have believed in a most high and 
good Creator of the Universe. Lang obtained 
most of his material from Australia, He believed 
that Australian tribes were the lowest races 
anywhere to be found. This is an assumption 
which at the present state of knowledge is not 
any more valid.” 2 

¥/undt contends that Lang made premature

generalizations on the basis of some evidence found 
with regard to the belief in a *muramura*. He quotes 
Howitt (The Natives Tribes of South-East Australia) 
to the effect that a comparatively high code of ethics^ 
- found among the tribes of S~S. Australia,has no 
connection whatsoever, in the mind of the natives, 
with a belief in a muramura. Respect for elders, 
neighborliness, charity, sex regulation is part of the 
ethics of these people but morality of this nature has 
with them no connection with belief in a Supreme Being. 
Wundt regards the material on which Lang based-.his hy¬ 
pothesis as *a gebrechliche Stuetze*. He quotes 
C. Strehlow (Die Aranda und Loritja Staemme in Central 
Australien) to the effect that these tribes did indeed 
believe in a *^igh' Being, but that highness in this 
case consisted" merely in a spatial relationship, the 
Being neither^rig^rded as Creator nor as a Helper or 
Saviour. Wundt has great confidence in this investig¬ 
ator because, though he was a missionary and might 
therefore have been a prejudiced observer, he knew the 
language of the tribes, enjoyed their confidence and 
spent many years in their midst. The ’High Being’ on 
which Strehlow reports was considered ’good’ only be¬ 
cause he was far enough away from human beings so as 
not to interfere adversely v»ith their plans and ambi¬ 
tions. Wundt suggests that this supposed ‘Great God*

-so¬ 


was believed in to ’ fi il a need to populate the vi/ide 
heavenly spaces’. He was not taken seriously. He was 
not vitally related to the hopes and fears of the 
people. Wundt's third criticism of this evidence of 
an original monotheism supposedly found among the prim¬ 
itive tribes of Australia is based on the fact that no 
cult was devoted to this god. 

"Corresponding to this indifference toward this 
heavenly being, there is a total absence of a 
cult, a defect which is all the more conspicuous 
because cults play a very important part in the 
lives of primitive peoples, so much so that there 
is no important event and no object fitted to 
stimulate feelings of fears and hopes, but a 
special 'Kultfest' is dedicated to it. btrehlow 
describes not less than 59 cults of the Aranda 
and 21 of the Loritja, but one and all.^^f these 
are dedicated to some totem; this (Langs) 
'Himmelshaeuptling' not only has no cult devoted 
to him but is not even incidentally considered 
in any of the other cults. And, without cult 
there is no God. And how could it possibly be 
that a God, as Andrew Lang claims, was already 
regarded by the primitive Australians as a 
Highest Being which revi/ards the good and punishes 
the evil, be possible and man not resort to efery 
form ofcult activities in order to win the good-will 
and help of such a Being?” 1 

Wundt, as a concession to the degeneration 

theory, admits 'Rueckbildungen' but vs?arns against 

'Unhaltbare Rueckschluesse'. 

"Rueckbildungen kommen freilich vor'^ admist 
Wundt, this has given support to the view that 
religious and moral ideas could not and would not 
have developed **wenn sie ihr nicht urspruenglich 
eingepflanzt- waeren" . However, as far as the 
philological foundation is concerned on which 
Mueller sought to base an 'Ur-religion'

Wundt sums up his criticism in the words "eine 
zweifelhafte und gaenzlich verfehlte elhnologische 
Hypothese," and holds that i^ang makes "unhaltbare 
Rueckschluesse auf eine Urreligion*" 2 

Nor do^s' th©. polytheistic, vi^.ypothusis' seem satis¬ 
factory to Wundt. Before the compass was discovered 
it was difficult for travellers to find their way 
through uncharted regions, particularly so when the 
starry heavens were not in view. And before the ®acon- 
ian inauction was fully developed seekers of the truth 
in any sphere of inquiry were in constant danger of 
being side-tracked and losing their way. 'fhe human 
mind has a persistent predilection for deduction. 

Humans always had and still have a weakness for setting 
up, or accepting, a hypothesis and regarding it as a 
water-tight thesis before they are really justified in 
doing so. ihe next inevitable and fatal step is for 
them to arrange data in such a way as to harmonize 
with the prematurely accepted doctrine. Anthropology 
as much if not more than any science has suffered from 
this seemingly ‘innate^ inclination toward a-prioristic 
modes of thinking. The science of religion, having to 
do with things that man appears to value above all 
else, has been slow in developing because of a reluct¬ 
ance to let go of inherited theses and to approach the 
problem of religious origins with an unbiased mind.

manifests itself undoubtedly also in the polytheistic 
hypothesis of Usener Usener: Goetternamen, 1896; 

According to the "‘Dreistufentheorie” of Usener 
the most original gods were 'momentary' in duration. 

He calls them ’*Augenblicksgoetter”. Any strange in¬ 
cident that causes human hearts to quake with fear, 
as the stroke of a lightning, calls forth such a god. 
”Sondergoetter‘% a second phase in the development of 
the god-concept, are of longer duration. They are still, 
however, associated with particular places and with 
particular purposes. Such gods are the guardians of 
particular cities, geographic regions, professions and 
strata of society. Finally, the 'allgemeinen Go et ter' 
are above the limitations of space and time, üven 
though these gods function still in a particular 
sphere, they nevertheless extend their dominion over 
all nature and humanity. And, while the momentary 
gods are definitely impersonal, and while the ‘special 
gods' begin to show indications of a gradual tendency 
to personify the gods, it is only at a third stage 
of its development that the god-idea becomes personified. 
A valuational aspect also enters into this theory of 
the development of the god-idea, in contrast to the 
older ‘degeneration* theory, this instance of a 







- 33 


polytheistic hypothesis definitely presupposes that 
there has been a gradual evolution of the god-idea. 

It has also the added advantage that it does not seek 
to develop the god-idea from a single source. Again, 
it does not seek to trace the development of the god- 
idea from a racial or national consideration, but 
derives it from universal human tendencies. ’’Auch 
kommt in dieser allgemeinen Gliedervjng eine 

t 

^ertabstufung zum Ausdruck*^. The valu^^ational aspect 

of the god-idea receives some consideration in this 
1 

hypothesis. 

Nevertheless, this hypothesis, too, suffers 
from being ''too logical^. The marks and basis of de¬ 
velopment have been chosen arbitrarily, in suggesting 
a gradual ‘fusion^ of previous god-ideas, usener has 
called attention to a very vital element in the develop¬ 
ment of the god-idea, noi^'ever, the theory does not do 
justice to the psychological conditions that bring about 
such fusion of such elements in the god-idea from v\?idely 
different points in space and time, ^furthermore, it 
is very doubtful, to say the least, that demons and 
ghosts that instill fear in the hearts of men, have 
any claim, as ‘Augenblickgoetter^ to being classified 
as the most original gods, uemons are not gods and do 
not even enter into the historical development of the 
1. v'oelkerpsychologie, 6,3, p. 6.

gods, contends wundt. Neither do the ghost-like beings 

that make their momentary appearance in forests, hills 

and meadows, even though they sometimes entt;r into the 

life of men and gods. ’♦Es bleibt dabei, dass der Daemon 

als solcher nicht mit dem Gott in die gleiche 

Entwickelungsreihe gebracht werden kann, weil er ein 

2 

von diesem specif isch verschiedenes Wesen ist." True 

gods are in fact a relatively late product. Originally 

there were no gods at all. Many of the characteristics 

of ghosts, souls and demons, beings which Usener would 

possibly classify as ’momentary♦ or as ’local’ gods, 

were eventually assimilated in the god-idea, but the 

real gods are not a mere intensification and extension 

of such characteristic. Gods are a new creation. 

3 

"Der persoenliche Gott ist eine Neuschoepfung*’. The 
distinguishing mark of a god is that he abides in a 
distant place, that he is ubiquitous if not always at 
first truly omnipresent, and finally that he is im¬ 
mortal. He is above apace and time. Furthermore, a 
god is a being that almost invariably retains the 
characteristic of a personal hero. Gods are to be 
found only where culture is advancedf^r enough to admit

of myths in which history and myth is united in legends 
of heroes. That is a comparatively late stage in human 
history. 

It would almost seem as if Alexander had been 

1 

anticipated by Usener. Alexander has, of course, a con- 
ception of God quite definitely his own. In positing 
that God is an entity which is progressively comprehen¬ 
sive and inclusive of wider space-time configurations, 
we cannot avoid seeing something that this theory has 
in common with that developed by the polytheistic and 
progressively monotheistic conception of God which we 
find in Usener as just presented. The idaa that progress 
is a matter of existence becoming configurations which 
are increasingly comprehensive, refined and complex, 
and that Deity is that quality of existence after which 
the highest and most refined and most complex configura¬ 
tion shows a constant nisus, and that God therefore 
never is but is always becoming is a theory of emergent 
evolution begun by Lloyd Morgan and developed by Alex¬ 
ander. And though Usener m.ay not have had anything like 
this in his m.ind, yet the idea of making numbers of 
units, comprehensiveness and extensiveness the basis 
and the measure of development appears to be something 
which after all Usener and Alexander had in common.

Closely allied with the polytheistic hypothesis 
of the development of the god-concept is the theory 
that god-ideas have their origin in natural phenomena. 

According to Max Mueller the gods came into existence 
through a misunderstanding. , He holds that men eorigin¬ 
ally endowed the sun, moon and stars as well as such 
weather phenomena as wind, clouds, lightning and thunder, 
with personality. Poets metaphorically spoke of such 
natural phenomena as if they were human beings. These 
poetical metaphors were later taken literally. Thus 
and then gods were born. According to this theory, 
theologians must look to ancient astrologers as their 
predecessors and books on astrology were superceded by 
books on theology. 

^If an original monotheism is nowhere to be found, 
one might be tempted to believe that polytheism 
represents the starting point of all mythology. 

*• In fact, until very recently this was doubtless 
the consensus of opinion among mythologists and 
■historians of religion, and the idea is still 
widely prevalent. For, if we hold in any way 
to the view that the god-idea is underived, there 
is but one recourse, once ‘we abandon the idea of 
an original monotheism. The polytheistic theory 
is, as a rule, connected with the further con¬ 
tention that god-ideas are directly due to celes¬ 
tial phenomena. In substantiation of this view, 
it is pointed out that, with the exception of the 
gods of the underworld, the gods are usually 
supposed to dwell in the heavens. Accordingly, 

• it is particularly the great heavenly bodies, 
the sun and the moon, or also the clouds and 
the storms, to which, these theoriestmce the

origin of the gods. Celestial phenomena were 
present to man i rom the beginning, and it is 
supposed that they aroused his reflection from 
the beginning, (and it is supposed that they 
aroused his reflection from earliest times on. 
Those mythologists who champion the celestial 
theory of the origin of religion, therefore, 
regard god-ideas as in great measure the products 
of intellectual activity; these ideas are supposed 
to represent a sort of primitive explanation of 
nature, though an explanation, of course, which, 
in contrast to later science, is fantastical, 
arbitrary, and’^under the control of emotion. 

In the first instance, it was the phenomena of 
storms, clouds, thunder and lightning that were 
thought to be the basis of deity belief; later, 
the sun came to be regarded as the embodiment 
of the chief god; the present tendency is to 
emphasize the moon.^—■ The gods, we are told, 
then gradually became distinguished from celes« 
tial objects and became independent personal 
beings. The heroes of the hero-saga are said 
to be degenerated gods,”" 1 

^*These theories of an original polytheism are 
rendered one-sided by the very fact that they 
are not based on any investigation whatsoever 
concerning the gods and myths actually prevalent 
in folk- belief. They merely give an interpreta¬ 
tion of hypothetical conceptions which are sup¬ 
posed to be original, and it is from these that 
' the gods of actual belief are derived.” 2 

If this mode of treatment does=more than give 

the creation of the mythologists* imagination, it clearly 

**‘leav-es out of consideration precisely those 
mythological ideas and religious views that realty 
live in folk-belief. Doubtless we may assume 
that celestial phenomena factored as assimilative 
elements in the formation of mythological con¬ 
ceptions. But such conceptions cannot possibly 
have been due exclusively to celestial factors, 
for the very reason that even where these are 
indubitably^ present, they are inextricably

interwoven with terrestrial elements, derived 
from man's immediate environment." 

Helios was indeed, as the name suggests, the 
god of the sun, even as Zeus and Thor were as¬ 
sociated with thunder and lightning.” 

"nevertheless, the Greeks no more identified 
the god Helios with the sun than they did Zeus 
himself with thunder and lightning. On the con¬ 
trary, these celestial phenomena were only at¬ 
tributes of the deities." 1 

But how is it that many peoples have pictured 
the heavenly regions as being populated with human¬ 
like, though more powerful, beings? 

"'These various interpretations of nature mythology 
overlook an important psychological factor which 
is operative even in elemental experiences, but 
which attains increasing significance in pro¬ 
portion as the psychical processes become more 
complicated, and especially therefore in the. 
formation of mythological conceptions. I refer 
to the assimilative fusion of psychical elements 
of differing origins. -Wo external object is 
perceived precisely as it is immediately given 
in reality, in the experience of it, there are 
fused numerous elements who''' source is within 
ourselves; these partly reenforce and partly 
suppress the given elements, thus producing what 
we call the *preception‘ or the apprehension of 
the object."2 

Concepts,as fusions of various elements of 
psychical and of physical origin, are usually emotionally 
coloured. 

*^he process of assimilation is greatly influenced 
by the emotions that may be present. To the 
frightened person thunder and lightning suggest 
a god who hurls the lightning, buch a person 
believes that he really sees this god. Either

the surrounding portions of the sky assume, in 
his imagination, thr form of an immense anthro¬ 
pomorphic being, or the thunder and lightning 
lead his^ze to the canopy of clouds, hidden 
back of which he thinks that he discovers, at 1 
least in vague outline, the thundering Zeus,” 

The ever-present tendency to read oneself 

into one’s enviroment is further illustrated. 

"A particularly striking illustration of the 
tremendous potency of the assimilative processes 
is offered by thefemiliar puzzle picture. In 
the picture of the folliage of,a tree there are 
sketched the outlines of the human face or of 
the head of a cat, Ah uninitiated observer sees 
at first only the foliage. Not until his at¬ 
tention has been directed to it, does he suddenly 
discover the head, unce, however, he has seen 
the latter, he cannot suppress it, try as he 
may* here again it is someuimes but a few distinct 
outlines that evoke the picture, fhe truth 
is that to a very great 'extent the observer reads 
the head into the drawing through the activity 
of his imagination. It is but natural that 
such an assimilation should be enhanced under 
the influence of the emotions which excite the 
mythological imagination,2 

The answer, then, to the question whether man 
is made in the image of God, or vice versa, and whether 
God created man or man-made his gods, finds its answer, 
as far as the ’^nature’ gods are concerned in the • suggestion 
that man has taken the initiative in the matter and that 
he has tended to fashion the gods after his own image, 

'^Thus, even those gods which might appear to be 
purely celestial deities, as, for example, Selios, 
or the lightning-hurling Zeus, are the products 
of a psychological assimilation of perceptual 
elements, the most important of which have their 
origin in terrestrial life. Hence it is that, 
wherever the nature myth has reached its complete 
development, the gods appear in human form,” 3

V/here animals or parts of an animal enter 
into the god-concept, either as supplying possibly the 
head of the deity, as is the case in Egyptian represent¬ 
ative of the deity, or where the deity is pictured as 
being accompanied by an animal, as in the case of Christ 
with the lamb, these zoomorphic elements along-side of 
anthropomorphic elements are the remains of ideas that 
held sway in the age of totemism. 

Ymndt'^s most fundamental criticism of the various 
hypotheses that have been advanced in an attempt to 
account for the origin of the god-idea is to the effect 
that they are too one-sided* They postulate one source 
from which the god-idea is supposed to have been derived* 
Even though such hypotheses are an improvement upon 
the old 'degeneration' hypothesis, they mre too 'con¬ 
structive’ • They tend to force the available data into 
a pre-conceived iform. They fail to take account of all 
of the facts that enter into the consideration* 

"*In the mythological assimilation complexes 
that gave rise to gods, celestial phenomena fur- 
. nished but a part of the elements. At best, 
they were the exciting stimuli; in many cases it 
is doubtful whether they exercised any influence 
whatsoever upon the origin of mythological con¬ 
ceptions.“ 1 

It is doubtful v\?hether there is any connection 
betvi/een the crescent moon and the flaming sword of the

angel at the entrance to laradise, or between that and 
the club of ttercules, as has been suggested by those 
who would trace all such mythological conceptions to 
one celestial source, 

•'Proof of the dominant importance of the terrest¬ 
rial environment is not far to seek. Even the 
celestial gods are conceived as men, or as anthro¬ 
pomorphic beings, and it is usually the earth 1 
that is regarded as the scene of their activity.'* 

Life is at all times a battle. Man is sur¬ 
rounded by dangers. The urge to survive is fundamental. 
It was but natural that man should take special notice 
of those elements in his environment that seemed es¬ 
pecially powerful and as having a direct bearing on his 
weal and v^oe. It is but natural that he should turn 
his gaze upward, heavenward, as the regions from which 
he might expect danger and from Vijhich he might also 
expect help. Man could hardly do anything else but 
conceive such helpers from heaven as in the terms with 
which he was familiar, Man always tends to conveive 
the unknown in terms of the known. Celestial and 
anthropomorphic gods were the natural products of the 
nomal mind, at a certain level of knov^ledge and cul¬ 
ture. iiowever, other elements than that of heavenly 
phenomena entered into the make-up of the gods, and 
therefore also into the characteristics of taod.

‘i'ylor*s animistic hypothesis, likewise, leaves 
some aspects of the genesis -a-wdrof the god-concept un¬ 
satisfactorily accounted for. vi/hen once the hypothesis 
of evolution began to ferment in the mind of man, the 
quest for origins in all spheres of life and thought 
began in earnest* That quest stimulated new and com- 
prehensiva inquiries also into the origin of elements 
in man*s spiritual inheritance. Among the first who 
ventured to make a guess at the origin and original 
nature of »aod on the basis of the evolutionary hy¬ 
pothesis were Herbert dpencer and E.B* Tylor. in 
‘Primitive culture*^ (1874) the latter advanced the 
theory that a belief in gods had gradually developed 
out of a belief in souls. God-ideas are only more 
highly developed soul-beliefs. Soul-ideas being simpler 
than god-ideas it may be safely postulated that they 
were prior, since evolution proceeds from the simple 
to the more complex. Essentially^ and qualitatively, 
souls, spirits, ghosts, demons, sprites, and gods are 
the same. The difference is one only of degree. 

using it (the term »animism*") to express 
the doctrine of spirits generally, it is practi¬ 
cally asserted that the ideas of souls, demons, 
deities and any other class of spiritual beings, 
are conceptions of similar nature thoughout, 
the conceptions of souls being the original 
ones of the series. - If it be admitted that 
souls and other spiritual beings are conceived 
of as essentially similar in their nature, it 
may be reasonably argued that the class of

conceptions based on evidence most direct and 
accessible to ancient man, is the earlier and 
fundamental class. To grant this, is in effect 
to agree that the doctrine of souls founded 
on the natural perceptions of primitive man, 
gave rise to the doctrine of spirits, which 
extends and modifies its general theory for new 
purposes.. It seems as though the conception 
of thehtoan soul, when once attained to by man, 
served as a type or model on which heffamed 
not only his ideas of other souls of lower grades, 
but also his ideas of spiritual beings in gensral 
from, the tiniest elf that sports in the long 
grass up to the heavenly Creator and Ruler of 
the world, the Great Spirit." 1 

According to the animistic hypothesis as 
represented by Tylor the difference between ghosts, 
spirits, souls and gods is, the»^ one merely of degree, 
not a difference of kind. Incidentally, this theory 
also posits that originally the god-concept contained 
no ethical elements. 

"To some the statement may seem startling, yet 
the evidence seems to justify it, that the re¬ 
lation of morality and religion is one that only 
belongs in its rudiments, or not ai all, to 
rudimentary religion. — So far as savage re¬ 
ligion can stand as representing natural religion, 
the popular idea that the moral government of 
the universe is an essential tenet of natural 
religion simply falls to the ground. Savage 
animism is almost devoid of that ethical element 
which to the educated m,odern mind (1874) is the 
very main spring of practical religion." 

^Tot that savage society has no code of be¬ 
haviour. But 

"these ethical laws stand on their own ground of

- 44 


tradition and public opinion, comparatively 
independent of the animistic beliefs and rites 
which exist beside them. The lower animism is 
not immoral. It is un-moral.” 1 

At a higher level, of course, the gods have 

had a great influence on conduct. 

”As a practical influence on society, it is 
clear that among its greatest powers has been 
its divine sanction of ethical laws„ its theo¬ 
logical enforcement of moral standards, its 
teaching of moral government ofthe universe, 
its supplanting the * continuance-doctrine * of 
a future life by the ‘retribution-doctrine’, 
supplying moral motive in the present”. But 
such alliance belongs almost wholly to relations 
above the savage level, not to lower and earlier 
creeds.” 2 

In contrast to a very widely held theory that 

the human emotions have been the principle factor in 

the creation and modification of the gods, anim.ism 

holds that the intellect has been the predominaht 

factor. That the gods have therefore grown out of a 

quasi-scientific quest for causes. 

**The intellectual rather than the emotional side 
of religion has here been kept in view. - Those 
to whom religion means above all things religious 
feeling, rmy say of my argument that I have 
written soullessly of the soul, and unspiritually 
of spiritual things. Be it so; I accept the 
phrase not as needing an apology, but as expres¬ 
sing a plan.” 3

In his evaluation and criticism of Tylor*s 
animistic hypothesis V/undt admits that soul~concepts are, 
indeed^an element in the god-concepts. He admits, too, 
that gods in some instances are itnown to have been de¬ 
graded into mere demons, as in the case of pagan deities 
at the advent of Christianity, This line of thought 
he admits to be ^unwiderlegbar' * Likewise, the ghost 
of an individual may in some instances have been elevated 
into a deity. He fails to see the justification for con¬ 
cluding from that^that there is no qualitative difference 
between a ghost and a god. No, The difference between 
a ghost and a god is more than a matter of degree, A 
god who has become a mere demon has ceased to be a god. 

He is not even a low-grade god. Individuality is an 
essential characteristic of a god. Personality divides 
a god from a mere demon, A god is not a mere addition 
of a demon and a hero concept. It is a synthesis of 
the two, different to and above either. It is a special 
new creation of the mythological imagination. The ani¬ 
mistic hypothesis of the origin of the god-idea suffers 
from that same logic and intellectualism which marks 
the Comtean classification of the sciences beginning 
with mathematics. Furthermore, a belief in souls alone 
can nowhere be proven. Neither cannot it be‘ proven that 
ghosts and demons are anywhere later than soul concepts.

'■i^hose fundamental marks of a god: Invincible power, 
derived from demons and heroes and present whenever 
human need requires it; omnipresence and immortality, 
must be present in germ at least if we are to speak of 
gods. 1 

•Lassen wir alles zusammen, so besteht demnach 
der Fehler der animistischen Hypothese darin, 
dass sie einen einzelnen in die Entwichelung des 
Goettermythus eingehenden psychologischen Factor 
der Gesamtheit der Factoren substituiert, unter 
denen einzelne allerdings ebenfalls die, 
Mitwirkung animistischer Motive vorraussetzen, 
andere aber und darunter namentlich die fuer die 
religiösse Wendung der Gottesidee bedeutsamsten 
neue Werte darstellen, die dem Seelenglauben 
ferne liegen. Der Mythus laesst sich eben 
nirgends, und er laesst sich begreiflicherweise 
am allerwenigsten in seinen hoechsten, und darum 
verwickelsten Gebilden aus einer einzelnen 
Wurzel ableiten oder auch nur aus einem 61oss 
aeursseren Nebeneinander verschiedener Motive 
begreifen, sondern er resultiert aus der Wechsel - 
Wirkung zahlreicher Factoren» die in ihrer 
Synthese neue Werte erzeugen. *^ f- 

Spencer*s ancestor hypothesis is but a parti¬ 
cular version of the animistic hypothesis and suffers, 
therefore, from the same defects. Originally man every¬ 
where respected, obeyed, sought to propitiate feared 
and expected help only from his earthly superiors. 
Biologically the first superior was the father. Having 
become accustomed to reverence thus his earthly father, 
or mother, man continued to reverence their doubles even 
after death. There arose the cult of the dead. Wor-

shippers sought to supply their dead ancestors with 

food, weapons, luxuries, and necessities. Out of the 

dead ancestors gradually gods were developed, ilulers 

and heroes were thus elevated into deities. Gods were 

developed from this one source* ^ survey of the mythology 

of Egypt, of the Greeks, the Romans, and more especially 

that of the Chinese and the Japanese, as well as the 

religious beliefs and practices of many primitive 

peoples substantiates the hypothesis that human ancestors 

were the original gods, «^uch is the ancestor-Ji^^othesis 

as proposed and defended especially by Herbert Spencer. 

^^Thus we find re-illustrated under other condi¬ 
tions, the same general truth that the primitive 
god is the superior man, either indigenous or 
foreign; propitiated during his life time and 
still more after his death.1 

'^Anything which transcends the ordinary, a savage 
thinks of as supernatural or divine: the re¬ 
markable man among the rest, ■‘■his remarkable 
man may be simply the remotest ancestor remembered 
as the founder of the tribe; he may be a chief 
famed for strength and bravery; he may be a 
medicine-man of great repute; he may be an in¬ 
ventor of something new. And then, instead of 
being a member of the tribe, he may be a superior 
stranger bringing arts and knowledge; or he may 
be one of a superior race predominating by‘con¬ 
quest. Being at first one or other of these, 
regarded with awe during hii life, he is regarded 
with increased awe.after his death; and the pro¬ 
pitiation of his ghost, becoming greater than 
the propitiation of ghosts which are less feared,

develops into an established worship. There is 
no exception then. Using the phrase ancestor- 
worship in its broadest sense as comprehending 
all worship of the dead,be they of the same blood 
or not, we conclude that ancestorworship is the 
root of every religion.” 1 

In Appendix a to this volume bpencer brings 

many instances of how peoples actually have worshipped 

dead men; in India dead robbers and fakirs were adored. 

”The more the evidence furnished by every race is 
looked into, the more irrestible becomes the con¬ 
clusion that gods were originally men: sometimes 
even ordinary men, belonging either to the tribe 
or to a conquering tribe. 2 

The Appendix was added in 1885, but even at 
that date Spencer held that*mana” too, was originally 
a man. 

”That this god *Mana* was originally a man as 
he is said to have been by the Kanjars, cannot 
well be doubted when we find cases in India of 
historical persons being deified, not by these 
inferior races only, but by the Aryans.” 3 

There does seem to be some psychological 
foundation for Spencer*^3 ancestor-hypothesis. For, what 
is psychologically more natural than that relations 
as they are found in the basic biological social unit 
should be projected first into the larger social unit 
and thence into the relationship of supernatural beings? 
Assuming for a minute that the debate about patriarchal,

matriarchal, or uncle-archal, origin of the family is 
settled in favour of the former, we find the father 
supplying the household with food, providing it with 
shelter and protection against man, beast and the ele¬ 
ments; giving commandments; rewarding the obedient, 
punishing the disobedient. He must be honored. He 
must be served. His will must be doiie. What seems 
psychologically more plausible than that these weil¬ 
and early-learned attitudes should be continued even 
after the body of such a head of the household lay 
mouldering in a cave, on an elevated platform, or in a 
shallow grave. To regard the * other-self^ of one who 
had occupied that social status, with reverence and awe, 
to look to him as a potential helper as well as a stern 
judge and author of punishment, seems not un-psychological 
and therefore not unreasonable. 

Y/e find, too, that ancestor-worship is a, if 
not the, predominant element in the religion of such 
ancient peoples as Japan, China, the ancient Egyptians, 
the Greeks, and more especially the Romans. Aristotle 
is reported to have called it ^extremely unlovely^ for 
anyone not to believe that the (dead ancestors continue 
to have an interest in the welfare of his descendants. 

The ^Japanese soldiers are said to have been greatly in— 
spired during the Russo-Japanese Vvar (1905) by the belief

that they were being observed by their dead ancestors* 
Romans, like Hindus, are said to have adopted a male 
child, in case of necessity, in order that there might 
be someone to continue the rites intended for the dead 
forbear* The Hebrew *adonai* may be rendered *my Lord* 
or *my lord*, even as *elohim* may be rendered as ‘kings* 
* judges*, or as *gods** 

Wundt admits, too, that it is impossible to con¬ 
ceive of gods without having previously been conceived 
of as souls* Likewise, the anthropomorphic ixharacter of 
the gods must be granted. Patriarchs and the‘god who 
gave promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob* are vitally 
related. God as the *father of all* is quite generally 
believed in. Yet, Wundt contends, the qualitative dif¬ 
ference between a human ancestor and a god is here not 
taken into consideration, and he regards the ancestor 
theory as a completely arbitrary supposition. 

**The theories maintaining the originality of the 
god-idea have more and more been displaced by the 
contrary view, namely, that the gods developed 
out of lower forms of mythological thought. Here 
there are two distinct interpretations* The first 
and the older is the ancestor theory. This re¬ 
presents a particular form of animism, for the 
soul of the ancestor is thought to become a god. 

The worship of the god, therefore, is held to have 
been originally a reverence (of the god, there¬ 
fore, is held to have been originally a reverence) 
paid to the ancestor* The main evidence for this 
view is found in the ancestor worship which is 
actually being practised am.ong many peoples, 
even at the present time* Prior to the Jahwe 
religion, such a cult is supposed to have

prevailed even among the Israelites. Do not the 
patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, appear 
as the ancestors of the later tribes of Israel? 
More significant still are the ancestor cults 
that have prevailed in bhina and Japan since very 
ancient times. It should be remembered, however, 
that these cults, wherever they occur, represent 
but more or less prominent elements or more ex¬ 
tensive mythological and religious conceptions. 
Hence, the ancestor-theory,also, is an arbitrary 
construction based on a presupposition which is 
in itself very improbable, namely, that all 
mythology and religion must eventusilly be traced 
to a single source. The contention, for example, 
that a Zeus or a Jahwe was a human ancestor 
elevated into a deity is a completely arbitrary 
supposition, lacking the confirmation of empirical 
facts." 1 

Wundt furthermore contends that animal- 

ancestry worship is found among very primitive people 

where the human ancestor cult is not yet found; that 

ancestor-worship is found nowhere alone; and that it is 

2 

usually predominant among advanced cultures. 

In ghintoism and Confucianism ancestor-worship 
may occupy a very prominent place, ancestors in the home 
and emperors in the nation may be the object of worship; 
in ^ome the ^parentalia^ may have been important 
festivals, the^Di manes’, the lares' and the lemures' may 
have been worshipped conscientiously; funeral practices 
may seem to support the hypothesis in a way. 

However, China* s ancient history and her

cultural isolation symbolized by the Great Wall, and 
Japan's isolation due to its island position, may ac¬ 
count for the peculiarnature of their gods. And as 
to funeral rites, these same people reverence ALL 
dead, and they respect ALL burial grounds, not only 
those of their ancestors. 

Nor is Marrett’s pre-animistic hypothesis 
regarded as satisfactory. Much as the early explorers 
ascended great streams in order, if possible, to dis¬ 
cover the head-waters of those great streams, anthro¬ 
pologists have, largely since 1859, entered into un¬ 
charted areas of primitive peoples in America, 
Australia, and Africa, in order, if possible, to dis¬ 
cover there the ^fons and origo' of present-day social 
institutions, customs, beliefs, rites and ceremonies. 

Among those who actually gathered data bearing on 
the problem certain names and places associated with 
those names stand out above others, e.g. Codrington 
among the Melanesians (1891), Rev. Strehlow among 
Central Australians, Father Schmidt among the pygmies 
of Africa (1910), Howitt among South-East Australians, 
(1902), ©pencer and Gillen among the northern tribes 
of Central Australia.v 

Among those who made outstanding attempts at 







- 5 3 - 

classifying and interpreting these data we find such 
names as Herbert Spencer (1878), Max Mueller (1878), 
E.B* Tylor (1874), Andrew Lang (1900), Wilhelm Wundt 
(1900), John King (1892), Marrett (1909), more re~ 
cently. Perry and Hivers (1923), Otto (1931) and 
many others* 

Those who have pryed into the god--ideas as 
they existed among such primitive peoples report fre¬ 
quently that the belief in some mysterious power, re— 
siding in strange and unfamiliar objects, objects in 
themselves often very insignificant, is very general. 
The strange, awe-inspiring power, sometimes found re¬ 
siding in a stone, such as quartz, other times in a 
stick, a place, an animal, then, by transference, also 
in certain persons, is known by various names. The 
Melanesians, as also the Israelites, called it ^mana^♦ 
The Iroquois Indians called it *orenda^, among other 
Indian tribes it is known as ^wakonda*. Belief in 
this mysterious power is usually associated with magic 
practices. Wundt, therefore, calls it the ^Zauber- 
theorie^. According to this theory, fear has given 
birth to spiritual beings and gods are therefore the 
children of fear.

John H. King is credited (by Wundt) with the

Evolution, 1892.

distinction of having first called attention to the 
existence of this generally-believed mysterious power, 

though the hypothesis is usually associated with the 

1 

name of R*R.. Marrett • 

In speaking of the ^uncanny^, ’supernal* 

power residing in unfamiliar objects, King cites 

instances to show that animals, such as dogs, cows, 

cats, cranes, even fish, are scared stiff, and stand 

quietly in awe of a suddenly-appearing, strange object 

or upon hearing a strange noise. He believes that 

gods were finally derived from this strange occult 

power residing in the unfamiliar and feared. 

’’Every man looked out for a power to protect 
him from the many mystic and natural dangers 
v/hich surrounded him. At first, any strange, 
uncouth, uncanny object, more especially if 
first seen under seeming protective conditions, 
denoted a power to ward off danger, and v/as 
secured as a precious charm. In a higher state 
he depended on the boylya of the medicine man; 

after, on the influence of ancestor spirits, 
angels and saints; and later on, upon tutelar 
deities and supreme gods. In a like course he 
evolved curative and prescient powers, and all 
. the mystic spiritual forces, and not least the 
power to control man, beast and all things by 
making use of the natural occult powers in 
days, words, and things.2 

It would seem that King even anticipated the 

psychological explanation which Dürkheim was later to 

1. The Threshold of Religion, 1909. 

2. The »supernatural. Its Origin, Hature and 
Evolution, p. 109.

evolve to account for the mysterious powers inherent 
in the particular objects. That the gods were born out 
of social gnpups seems to be suggested in the following 
lines: 


**It is evident that the god-powers aggregated 
as through various circumstances the people 
aggregated, and that they grew from femily gods 
to be clan-gods, then tribal- and ultimately 
district-gods.” 1 

Again, 

”Each local group of men evolved their supernal 
ghost powers from their own race and their own 
surroundings, and the attributes they attached 
to these powers were in all cases derived from 
the status in evolution of their own or neigh¬ 
bouring races. Men could only attach powers 
to the ghosts or spirits in accord with those 
present in the natural world, physical or vital; 
hence, as men advanced in mental, moral, and social 
aspirations, so did their gods, and in 
the attributes attached to their gods, we have 
the marks of the human social evolution. The 
transcendental attributes attached to spiritual 
manifestations were in all cases derived from 
ideal readings of natural perceptions.” 2 

The mysterious power which eventually was 
to become known as God had its beginning in * chance 
luck* and passed through stages of evolution such as

death manifested the same protective attributes 
as when living; more so when, through the social 
development, ancestral spirits were evolved and 
conjointly therewith the doctrine of totem 
descent which raised, animals, trees, and all 
physical manifestations into spirit kin- 
protectors. These began their supernal ex¬ 
pressions in the individual, then the family, 
and after into tribal protectors, ultimately 
evolving into the religion of tutelar deities. 

The subsequent ^od-phases which have been evolved 
pass from confederations of associate tutelar 
powers to the ascendency of a Regal deity then 
to that of a Supreme Autocratic deity, and 1 
lastly to that of the Universal Abstract God." 

To-day religious-minded people seek to know 
and possess God. To be God-filled, godly, divine, 
that is the goal of religious aspiration. Once upon 
a time, men sought to possess ’mana’. In each case 
it is a quest for some mysterious power. Hence *mana^ 
represents God in his initial stage of development. 

Such is the hypothesis of the pre-animistic school. 
Codrington (The Melanesians, 1891) defines »'mana* 
as 

*^a force altogether distinct from physical 
power, which acts in all kinds of ways for 
good and evil, and vi/hich it is of the greatest 
advantage to possess or control". 2 

"If a man has been successful in fighting, 
it has not been his natural strength of arm, 
quickness of eye or readiness of resource 
that has won success; he has certainly got 
the ’mana^ of a spirit or of some deceased 
warrior to empov^er him, conveyed in an amulet 
of a stone round his neck, or a tuft of leaves

in his belt, in a tooth hung upon a finger of 
his bow hand, or in the form of words with 
which he brings supernatural assistance to his 
aid. If a man's pigs multiply, and his gardens 
are productive, it is not because he is indust¬ 
rious and looks after his property, but because 
of the stones full of *mana* for pigs and yams 
that he possesses* Of course, yam naturally 
grows when planted, that is v^/ell known, but 
it will not be very large unless *mana* comes 
into play; a canoe will not be swift unless 
*mana’ be brought to bear upon it, a net will 
not catch many fish, nor an arrow inflict a 
mortal wound.’’ 1

And similarly spoke the Psalmist 

’’Except the Lord build the house, they labour 
in vain who build it; except the Lord keep the 
city, the watchman waketh in vain.” 

Marrett, whose name is usually associated 

with the pre-animistic hypothesis resents Wundt’s 

suggestion that a rival hypothesis to that of animism 
3 

is proposed. Nevertheless, Marret holds that the be¬ 
ginnings of the god-concept must be sought in some¬ 
thing wider and vaguer than the souls of the dead. 

”I had no intention of committing myself to a 
definite solution of the genetic problem. For 
me the first chapter in the history of religion 
remains in large part undecipherable. My chief 
concern was simply to urge that primitive or 
rudimentary religion, as we actually find it 
amongst the savage peoples, is at once a wider 
and in certain respects a vaguer thing than 
the 'belief in spiritual beings* of Tylor's 
famous minimum defintion. Closely allied with 
the 'mana* concept is usually found the idea of 
’taboo*. In mana-taboo ideas Marrett finds 
the raw material for the separation between 
the sacred and the profane.”

Everything *spiritual% non-materia^, non¬ 
natural, super-natural, can be traced back to this 
fountain headC'mana. Out of ^mana^ has come man’s 
gTeatest values, both those which he approves and 
loves as well as those which he fears, hates, and dis¬ 
approves of. In other words, both God and Satan have 
their origin in mana-taboo ideas* 

”“1 have said enough, I trust to show that there 
exists, deep-grained in the rudimentary thought 
of the world, a conception of a specific aspect 
common to all sorts of things and living beings, 
under which they appear at once as needing in¬ 
sulation and as endowed with an energy of high, 
since extraordinary, potential, - all this 
without any reference to the bearing of these 
facts on human welfare. In this connection I 
would merely add that our stock antithesis 
between magic and religion becomes applicable 
only when we pass from this to the second or 
moral dimension of the supernatural. Presented 
in its double character of’tabu’ and ’mana* 
the supernatural is not moral or immoral, but 
simply unmoral* — I conclude then, that mana, 
or rather the tabu-mana formula, has solid 
advantages over animism, — Mana is coextensive 
with the supernaturalpanimism is far too wide* 
Mana is alv^ays mana, supernatural power, differ¬ 
ing in intensity - in voltage, so to speak, - 
but never in essence*” 1 

Marrett believes that in ’mana* he has found 
something thich all religions and all foms of magic 
have in common. 

^Anthropomorphic theism, a view that is bred 
from animat ism rather than from, animism proper, 
denominates many of the higher creeds, but not 
all. Buddhism is a standing example of an ad-

vanced type of religion that exalts the im¬ 
personal aspect of the divine. It is, again, 
especially noticeable how a thinker such as 
Plato, with all his interest in soul, human 
personality and the subjective in general, 
hesitates between a personal and an impersonal 
rendering of the idea of God. Thus the ambig¬ 
uity that lies sleeping in *mana^ would seem to 
persist to some extent even when ireligious ex¬ 
perience is at its most self-conscious. In 
the mean time all religions, high and low, 
rudimentary and advanced, can join in saying 
with the Psalmist that *power belongeth to 
God.” 1 

More recently this hypothesis has been ad- 

2 

vanced by W. Robertson Smith and still more recently 
3 

by Rudolph. He speaks of the * numinous', the 
'irrational’ and supra-rational’ 

Wundt quite readily agrees that feeling 
rather than reason is the fountain-head of religious 
ideas. However, *er fasst den Begriff des Animismus 
zu eng' in this that he excludes 'corporate' soul as 
a predominant factor in the development of the god- 
concept. Furthermore, ‘he credits the primitive 
mind with abstractions of which he is not capable.’ 
V/undt has' a very definite definition of a 'god' and 
since in his estimation, a mere, vague, impersonal 
power, does not come under his definition of a god, 
he holds that the ’pre-animistic hypothesis, too, 
has missed the mark.

*^The decisive enphasis in the case of deity- 
ideas in general must be placed on the attri¬ 
bute of personality* Gods are personal beings, 
whose characters reflect the peculiarity of 
the people who have created them* We see in 
the God Jahwe of the Israelites the clear-cut 
lines of the stern god who threatens the dis¬ 
obedient but who also rewards the faithful. 

More impressive still is the uniqueness of the 
personality in those cases in which a multi¬ 
plicity of gods causes the development of 
diverse and rpartly opposed characteristic of 
the various gods. How individual are the gods 
of the Greeks with respect to one another. 

Under the influence of poetry every god has 
here become a clearly defined personality, whose 
individuality was fixed by formative art. Thus, 
the error of the ^demon theory*' lies in the 
fact that it effaces the essential distinc¬ 
tions between god and demon, retaining as the 
chief characteristic of the multitude of result¬ 
ing deity-conceptions only the most external 
quality, that of permanence1 

Vfundt also criticizies the pre-animistic 
hypothesis on the ground that it posits the development 
of the god-idea as going from the abstract to the con¬ 
crete, something quite out of harmony with the evolu¬ 
tionary theory. Marrett rejoins however, 

"I say not that its evolution proceeds from the 
abstract to the concrete - which would be mean¬ 
ingless -, but that it proceeds from the indis¬ 
tinct to the distinct, from undifferentiated 
to differentiated, from incoherent to coherent* 
And that, I claim, is a hypothesis which has 
the best part of evolutionary science at its 
back.*^ 2 

The ‘mana‘ concept is certainly one of the 
roots of the god-idea. It has made an important contri¬ 
bution toward that complex synthesis called god.

It has supplied the unlimited power element. However, 
it is a mistake, holds Wundt, to think that it is the 
one and only source of that idea. 

We , again, might query Wundt and ask: But is 
that really true? Is personality an indispensible 
element in the concept of 'God'? ^hall we deny God 
to those who feel that they can no longer believe in 
an anthropomorphic God? Have they not very good, not 
to say the very best, authority on their side who hold 

that ^God is a Spirit and that they who worship Him 

1 

must worship Him in spirit and in truth?” The theo- 
logically inclined might insist on writing ^Spirit* 

with a capital while the more philosophicair 

/ 

might be content with, or even insist, that the word 

be written with a small 's'* nevertheless, I think, 

both would agree that ‘'godliness ‘ is a matter of the 

spirit and that a 'godly^ person is one who is imbued 

with the Spirit of God, i.e. one vi/hose spiritual life 

is qualitatively different from that of an ungodly 

person* So that after all, we had better not abandon 

the trail broken by J.H. King and R.R. Marrett too 

soon when we go in quest of the true and essential, 

as well as original nature of God. 

Since the days of Wundt, other hypotheses of 

the origin of the god-concept have been advanced. 

Thirteen years after Wundt had written 'finis' to his 
1. John 4, 24.

»Voelkerpsychologie (1910), and six years after he 
had »finis' written to his scholarly and industrious 
life, W.J. Perry brought forward »»The Origin of Magic 
and Religion»* (1923). Instead of collecting data 
that might shed light on the problem of origins among 
living, primitive, peoples in Australia, Africa and 
America, Perry endeavoured to break into the ^mysterium 
mysteriorum*' by using remains of pre-historic civili¬ 
zations in Egypt, Sumer, G-rete, southern France and 
Spain, brought to light by the excavations of archeo¬ 
logists. Perry, guided and supported by Prof. Elliot 
Smith, postulates that man*s most original serious 
concern was to survive. He sought life and valued 
highly whatever seemed to him to give and sustain life. 
Now, there can be no serious quarrel about the validity 
of that thesis. Man, like other forms of organic life, 
seeks the most abundant, the most care-free, the long¬ 
est possible life. From first hand experience man 
early learned of a vital connection between life and 
blood. The loss of blood would often be seen to be 
closely associated with the loss of life. A causal 
relationship between the two would be a simple 
conclusion. Because of their similarity in colour, 
man came to value many things that were of a blood 

colours red ochre, red berries, red rocks, and, for 
this and another reason, especially also gold.

Likewise from first hand observation, man 

learned to associate the origin of life with the 

female organ of women. Hence, man valued pre-eminently 

as a * life-giver* the coweie shell found on the shores 

of the Red Sea, because of its resemblance to the 

original fountain of life, Hy way of resemblance-in- 

shape man passed easily to the point where he valued 

highly the date, its stone bearing marked resemblsince 

again to the organ that gave life. »Similarly also 

barley and millet, and eventually also beer, as the 

drink made of barley, v/as highly valued as a ’life- 

giver^. Once water, in the land of irrigation and 

a 

Nile inundations, had become known as/vital factor in 
life and growth, also pottery and especially pots 
resembling the cowrie shell and resembling also the 
shape of a woman came to be highly esteemed, -t^or 
this reason, too, Great Mothers of ancient civiliza¬ 
tions, such as Aphrodite in Greece, Hathor in Egypt, 
the Lady of the Turquoise on the Sinaitic Penihsula 
and finally the multitude of Madonnas found in ancient 
and in less ancient civilizations, occupy a high place 
in the life of p?e-historic peoples. From mothers 
there is no wide step to life-giving food, as milk, 
from milk to cow , and finally to the Divine Cow, 
sometimes with norns as an emblem of protection against 

dangers, and other times without horns as the source 
of life-£^iving food. Again, from respect paid to

milk, it is a small step to value highly the milk¬ 
like juice of trees and the trees themselves. 

Gold came to be valued because it lent itself 
to the making of artificial life-givers (cowrie shells, 
etc.; and probably also because of its colour, -^he 
valuational attitude over against gold spread from 
Egypt to other countries when Egyptian traders went 
in quest of that very precious metal* Others came to 
regard gold as the * elixir of life,' able to give 
immortality. 

Much as we admire the dexterity with which 

Messrs. Smith and Perry step from stone to stone in 

building up their hypothesis, and however much we may 

agree that the quest for survival has provided an 

incentive for the eternal search of 'life-givers', 

we are hesitant to follow implicitly. With the spirit 

of Wundt still hovering about us we seem to see him 

shake his head, mildly skeptical, whispering! ®Zu

not even organic, let alone psychic, is so simple as 

all that.** However, here it isj 

"In delving into the remotely distant history 
of our species we cannot fail to be impressed 
with the presistence with which, throughout 
the whole of his careet?, man has been seeking

regarded as ended), to prolong the a ays of active 
life to the living, to restore youth, and to 
protect his own life h?om all assaults, not merely 
of time but also of circumstances. In other 
v^ords, the elixir he sought was something that 
would bring him ‘good luck* in all the events 
of life and its continuation. Most of the amu¬ 
lets, even of modern times, the lucky trinkets* 
the Averters of the Evil Eye, the practices and 
devices for securing good luck in love and 
sport „ in curing bodily ills and mental distress 
in attaining material prosperity, or a contin¬ 
uance of existence after death, are survivals 
of this ancient and persistent striving after 
those objects which our earliest forefathers 
called collectively ‘Givers of Life*.” — 


Again— 

”Once the conception of a Great Mother had 
arisen, Heligion was in the making, although 
in these early stages it had but few of the 
features that characterize it nov^adays. The 
Great Mother was at first but little more than 
an amulet. Nevertheless she was, as Elliot 
Smith insists, the first deity that man turned 
to for consolation and protection from the 
manifold dangers of this mortal life.” 1 

With the development of civilization the 
Great Mother had to assume various protective.func¬ 
tions. In burner, and then in Egypt, where Terry 
finds the cradle of civilization, she assumed the 
function of a city god. In assuming different func¬ 
tions with increasing complexity of economic and social 
life, the Great Mother assumed at times a different 
sex. Why, is not said. Real gods did not appear on 
the scene until, due ito scarcity of food, no doubt, 
food-gathering activities were replaced by food- 
producing and, thus, with the age of agriculture.

The Kings of Sumer and the Pharaohs of Egypt were re¬ 
garded as the Sons of the Great Mother god* Tamniuz 
of Sumer and Osiris of Egypt were thus among the first 
gods* At the san^e time they were real kings at one 
time. Control of the Nile flood waters,, pyramids, 
and mummification helped to make these gods powerful 
and immortal. Says Elliot Smith: 

*^siris was the prototype of all gods; his 
ritual was the basis of all religious ceremonial; 
his priests who conducted the animating cere¬ 
monies were the pioneers of a long series of 
ministers who for more than fifty centuries, 
in spite of the endless variety of details of 
their ritual and the character of their temples, 
have continued to perform ceremonies that have 
undergone remarkably little essential change.^* 1 

The priests of Heliopolis in southern Egypt, 
with the help of their solar theology and the worship 
of the sun god He, elefated the Klings of Egypt into 
the heavenly regions and made them to be the Children 
of the Sun. 

The spread of civilization is accounted for by 

Perry as a quest for God, the ^iver of Life. 

•^The spread of civilization was due to the 
desire for givers of life, that were to be 
found in the earthly paradise. The earthly 
paradise was a place with great quantities of 
gold, pearls and other desired substances. 

Access to it was reserved for favoured mortals, 
for the sons of the gods. All the world over 
it is found that traces exist of the presence 
of people with a high degree of civilization 
in such places, and the cultures of these 

1. Quoted by Perry, p* 33, ibid.^ 









- 67 - 


communities are so similar to that of Egypt in 
the Pyramid Age as to afford every reason to be¬ 
lieve that they were derived from that source* 
Since access to the earthly paradise was reserved 
for sons of the gods, since, also, the idea of 
divine descent evidently began in Egypt, it vjould 
be expected that these early communities in the 
earthly paradises would be ruled over by the 
Children of the Sun* Inquiry shows this to be 
the case;' 1 

Perry goes on to trace the spread of culture 
traits, from archaic Egypt to all parts of the world, 
Melanesia, Oceania, China, Japan, Mexico, Peru, North 
American Indians, etc. Everywhere*the prevailing god- 
idea shows elements of an original quest for * life- 
givers*, Mother Gods, sun worshippers, deified rulers, 
children of the Sun, theogamy, creation myths, and, of 
course, a line of priests who trace their origin to 
Sgypt*. There is then but one source of the god-idea, 
Egyptr* From there it has *wandered* to all parts of 
the'world. Of course, he admits that ideas of God and , 
ideas related thereto have been modified by local con¬ 
ditions* So that the god-idea whereever found does 
represent to some extent the experiences of those 
peoples, but he does admit spontaneous growth of relig¬ 
ious concepts or creations peculiar only to Egypt* 
Elsewhere they have been imported, by men who were in 
quest of precious * lif e-givers *, cowrie shells, stones, 
gold, metals* 

It is noteworthy, suggests Wundt, byway of

criticizing the Great Mother Hypothesis, that those who 
try to trace the origin of the god-idea to one single 
source, tend to direct attention to that geographic 
region which at this or that particular time happens 
to be the object of special interest and inquiry* 

Thus at the beginning of the 19th Century, India was 
thought to have been the mother of all culture and also 
the originator of all prevailing god-ideas. During the 
middle of that century, Egypt was thought to have pro¬ 
duced the gods and civilization, üitymology and archae¬ 
ology have been the main supports of this hypothesis. 

At one time Babylonia was thought to have been the 
fountainhead of all god-centred cultures. 

•’If there is anything which anthropology has est¬ 
ablished as a certain fact, it is this—that the 
characteristics of the human imagination (Phantasie) ; 
the feelings and affections which give direction 
to the imagination^is in all essential traits 
identical among peoples of all zones and countries; 
and that it requires, therefore, no hypothesis 
of migration (of which the Greatf; ' Mother Hypothesis 
is but one exaniple) to account for the wide¬ 
spread similarity of god-ideas and cultures found 
in all parts of the world.” 1

Chapter Three:Wundt*s Hypothesis , 

V/e come now to a discussion of Wundt*s own 
hypothesis on the development of the god-concept. How- 
ever» before we enter into a more detailed discussion 
of the psychological fountain heads out of which god- 
concepts have emerged and of the laws according to which 
such concepts have grown, we shall do well to state 
Wundt*^s conception of a »god». Much debating and arguing 
is so much wasted effort and gets the debaters nowhere 
merely because no common ground has been agreed upon. 
Debaters start out from different premisses. A de¬ 
finition of terms is desirable. 

What iSjprecisely, the difference between a 
soul, a ghost, a demon, a hero and a god? What are 
the intrinsic marks that differentiate a god from other 
mythological creations? 

»»Herewith we come to a question which will bring 
us closer to an anBV^er respecting the origin of 
the gods. By what characteristic marks is a 
mythological conception to be distinguished as 
that of an actual god? The question might also 
be stated in a more concrete form. What char¬ 
acteristics differentiate a god from a demon, 
who is not yet a god because he lacks person¬ 
ality, and from a hero, who is regarded by the 
age in which gods originate as somewhat approxi- 
- mating a god but as nevertheless still a mem? 

Or, briefly expressed, how does the god differ 
from the demon and from the ideal man? The 
criteria thus demanded are to be found in the

traits that are universally ascribed to gods 
whereever any complete deity mythology and a 
corresponding religion have been developed. 
The god is always distinguished, by three 
characteristics.” 1 

”The first of these characteristics is ' 
that his place of abode is I *: other than 
that of a man. He may occasionally visit man 
on the earth, but this occurs only rarely. 

So far as he himself is concerned, the god 
lives in another world. In this sense, the 
idea of a »beyond» is closely bound up with 
that of the gods. As a rule, the »beyond» is 
the heavenly world. But gods may dwell also 
in the regions of the air and the clouds be’— 
tween the heaven and the earth, on high moun¬ 
tains, on distant islands, or, finally, under 
special circumstances, in the depths of the 
earth. Secondly, the gods lead a perfect life 
free, on the whole, from the evils and infirm¬ 
ities of earthly existence. A perfect life, 
however, is always regarded primarily as a 
life without death and without sickness. - The 
most universal characteristics of the gods are 
that they know neither death nor sickness.»» 

There are, however, occasional exceptions 
just as there are with respect to the supra-mundane 
place of abode. The Greek as well as the Germanic 
deity sagas represent the gods as possessing a part¬ 
icular food ^arndr-a--partieula-r—f€K>d and a particular 
drink, an idea connected with that of the anthropo¬ 
morphic nature of these gods. The Germanic gods, 
especially,are described as* capable of maintaining 
their perfect life only by far exceeding the human 
measure of food and drink. More important is the

fact that if, by any unfortunate circumstance, food and 
drink are lacking the gods waste away and meet the 
universal lot of human existence - death. — In view 
of the actual decline of the former gods, the thought 
of a *Goetterdaemmerung» must almost inevitably have 
forced itself upon them. At any rate, inasmuch as 
this particular conception represents the gods as 
subject to death, it contains an element that is bound 
up with the anthropomorphic nature of the divine 
beings. We are thus brought to the most important 
characteristic of the gods which is connected with 
this very fact of their similarity to man. i'he god is 
a personality^ he has a specific personal character, 
which gives direction to his will and leads him to 
send blessings or misfortunes to mortals. These purely 
human characteristics, however, he possesses in an 
exalted and complete measure. His will-acts, as well 
as the emotions from which they spring and the in¬ 
sight by which they are guided, are superhuman in 
power. But this power is not (yet) equivalent to 
omnipotence. This it cannot be by the very reason of 
the multiplicity of gods, each of whom has a parti¬ 
cular sphere of activity. Frequently, moreover, 
omnipotence is rendered impossible by the idea— 
likev^ise carried over from the terrestrial to the 
supermandane world~-of a destiny, an impersonal power

behind the wills of the gods no less than those of 
men. This is a conception which deity beliefs inherit 
from the earlier demon beliefs. True, polytheistic 
myth itself takes a step in the diruction of trans¬ 
cending this limitation when it here also transfers 
the conditions of the human order to the divine world, 
and creates for the latter a monarch, a supreme 
deity, ruling over gods and men. but this very pro¬ 
jection of human relations into the divine realm 
prevents the chief deity from being an unlimited 
ruler. —The advent of gods nowhere led to the com¬ 
plete banisliment of demons. Vi/hat occurred was that, 
due to the power of the gods, certain of the demons 
likewise developed into mighty forces of destiny, 
though continuing to remain impersonal. Thus the god 
possesses three characteristics: a special dwelling 
place, immortality, and a superhuman, though at the 
same time a human, personality. 1 

Souls, as a component part of demon concept, 
must therefore also be regarded as an integral element 
in the god-concept. Since the- god-concept is a 
stream which has, in part, been formed by a confluence 
of the demon-and the hero-concept, it will be necessary, 
for a proper understanding of the god-concept, and 
the manner of its development, to uncover the fountain-

head of the »demons* and the ’hero concepts’. Now, 
demons can be traced back to 'souls'. God-ideas 
have their origin, partly,in demon-beliefs; demon¬ 
beliefs have their origin, partly, in soul-ideas. 

But where do soul-beliefs have their origin? 

Are the 'öouls' a "particular application 

la 

of the belief in sacred things", as Dürkheim holds? 

Are soul-concepts, like all other concepts, of purely 
social origin? Is it but a 'totemic principle in¬ 
carnate in the individual? Is.it 'mana' individ¬ 
ualized? A product of the social experience? If 
soul beliefs are the very fountain of that dualism 
of matter and spirit, body and soul, naturalism and 
spriritualism which has been a bone of contention 
among philosphers of all, including our own, ages; 
if to them we must trace the conflict between theo¬ 
logians and scientists, religion and science, we shall 
do well to uncover, if possible, the origin of these 
beliefs. If 

"to it we owe the conception of spiritual 
beings and if at some relatively late stage 
of culture it became absolute in the ideas 
of God" 1 

and if it is the *^original cell* out of which has 

of 

come the inspiration/all intellectual speculation,

theological, metaphysical and scientific, we shall 

be interested in knowing how Wundt traced the origin 

and development of this soul-concept. It if was 

originally not God's but psyche’s task and service 

rendered to society to engender and maintain respect 

for law and authority, respect for and security of 

life and property, to safegrard sexual purity^ and if 

ghosts have done more than gallows to restrain those 

who were unable to restrain themselves as T.G. Frazer 
1 

suggests then it will be necessary and worthwhile 
to trace the origin and the family tree of these 
souls'. It will be interesting to know why they 
were born, when and how they came into existence. 

And what justification there is for society to grant 
her children, and more especially her Child, God, 
a respectable place in society today. 

Wundt suggests a double origin of the soul- 

2 

concept. 

‘’The concept ’soul' is met with in two essent¬ 
ially different form.s. One of these we may 
call the 'corporate* soul (die gebundene Seele). 
In this form 'soul' is a feature, or character¬ 
istic’ of the living body. With this we shall 
contrast the ’free soul’ (vom Koerper trennbare 
Seele) 

1. Ps'| 2 he’s Task, p. 153. 

2, pp. 80-81 Voelkerpsychologie, Vol. 4, Part 1.

Both soul concepts become fused at an early 
date* A common element in both concepts is 
found in this that the soul everywhere appears 
as a corporately conceived being. Never is 
the soul *ein von ihrer koerperlichen Er-!»— 
scheinung geschiedenes Object'. Souls and soul¬ 
carrying objects are considered as one and the 
same* They become divided in the effect they 
have on other persons and objects* Out of 
this have grown ideas of magic* On the primi¬ 
tive level of thought the most varied soul- 
concepts can exist alongside of each other 
without calling forth the least suggestion of 
inconsistency* The ^unbegrenzte Vereinbarkeit 
disparater feiegriffe* is a characteristic of 
the human mind, at the primitive level* ''•'hen 
philosophy was in its infancy there were no 
powers of abstraction even as there was no 
need for harm*ony, integration and unification. 
Mind at the primitive level is not puzzled by 
contradictions. The idea of a uniform "soul- 
concept among primitives is a m.istaken as¬ 
sumption of many scholars* 

Ideas ofabody-soul account for many strange 
primitive practices* It is difficult for the primitive 
mind to dissociate, in death, for instance, those 
things that he has been accustomed to associate in 
life time* Hence,he continues to believe that the 
body in some slightly different way continues to 
live* Everywhere, therefore, one finds attempts to 
preserve the body, or at least some part of the body 
which lends itself to preservation* The aead body, 
even though it makes no more movements, is still 
thought to hear and see, ‘■^‘he corpse is still addres¬ 
sed and petitions are expressed in its presence* It

It is still tenderly cared for, supplied with food, 
v/eapons, jewels, servants, garments, etc. Funeral 
rites of a great variety have their origin in this 
corporate-soul concept. The death wake, impulsive 
cries of agony, in the presence of a corpse, mum¬ 
mification, embalming as it is practiced even to-day, 
belief in a bodily resurrection of the dea(J,are 
practices and beliefs which have their origin in 
the belief of a corporate-soul concept. Importance 
attached not only to corpses, but to organs of the 
body which lent themselves to preservation, such as 
the hair, skull, teeth, as well as parts of the body 
in which the life principle was believed to reside, 
has its origin in this failure to dissociate life and 
a dead body. Native Australians thus carry the kidney 
as an amulette, and eat the heart, or drink the blood 
of one whose souls they believed could help them in 
their life-struggles. Scriptural expressions, such 

as 'God trieth the heart and the reins' 'I was 

2 

pricked in my heart and my reins' have their origin 
and explanation in this belief. For this reason the 
kidneys and the fat around it were favored objects 
in sacrificial practices. 1‘he *nephros' either kidney

testicles, as well as the 'phallus* played on important 
part in later vegetation cults. 1‘hese were a 'magi¬ 
cal means of increasing soil, plant, and animal fer'— 
tility. Friendships were sealed by mutually sucking 
the blood of the contracting parties, for thus the 
'souls* of the two were fused, -t^lood union constitued 
soul union. Excrements, as urine, spit, sweat, were 
likewise regarded as ^soul-carriers*, fhe *evil eye' 
came to have such importance because the eye, break¬ 
ing as it did in death, was regarded as the conveyer 
of some one's soul, for good or ill. In manhood 
ceremonies among the i^apuans on New Guinea the urine 
of the chief played an important part. The 'soul*^ 
of the chief was thus conveyed to the novices. Im¬ 
portance was attached to spittal even in Biblical 

days for this reason. For this reason Samson's 

1 

'strength* left him when his hair was cut. The hair 
of a sick person is at times carried away or buried 
in a tree, for thus the evil soul was thought to be 
removed from the patient. The Angola negro cuts the 
hair and the fingernails of a dead friend and sends 
them home, even as fond mothers today save the curls 
of a deceased baby, believing thus to retain some¬ 
thing vital of the deceased person. Objects of daily

use thus also came to be regarded with reverence and 
awe, because the soul of a near relative or a great 
chief was believed to have passed into these objects♦ 
Through immediate contact possessions of a dead chief 
might thus become instruments of magical power* 

They were 'soul-carriers** Thus Wundt accounts for 
the origin of the *mana* of the Melanesians, the 
*wakan* of the Dakotahs, the 'orenda* of the Iroq^uois. 
Amulettes and talisman derived their magical power 
from their contact with the dead, "^hey, too, are 
* soul-carriers *. Demons and demoniacal powers have 
their origin here. \/*hen the ‘corporeal soul concept* 
becomes fused with the *free soul* the former becomes 
more mobile and more easily transferable tfrom one 
object or person to another. The soul-concept of 
Homer in the Odyssey stands about mid-way between 
the corporeal soul-concept and the *psychetconcept 
of the soul. In Homer the physical elements tend, 
to recede before the psychical elements in the soul- 
concept. It marks a transition in the gradual process 
of spiritualization of the soul-concept. God as a 
Spirithas his origins at this point* At the threshold 
of culture and even to-day the problem is debated: 

Is the soul seated in the head, or in the heart. 

Plato posited the soul in the head, in reason, while 
Aristotle believed it to be found in the hearty in 
the *thumos^^ the emotions*

Priority in point of time is conceded to the 
body-soul idea. This is in keeping with the psycho¬ 
logical and evolutionary law that progress is from 
the perceived to the conceived and from the concrete 
to the abstract, from the visible and material to the 
invisible and immaterial. As the body-soul idea 
became associated with blood and vital organs, as 
also with the worm which might be observed as coming 
from a decaying body, and subsequently with the serpent, 
because of similarity with the worm, so the breath, 
ceasing as it did at the instant of death, came to 
i be associated with the life principle, or soul. 

Etymolog;^»' bears witness to the widespread conception 
of the soul as breath, *^psuche’, even as ^animus ^ 
may mean breath, soul, or life. ^Pneuma' means 
originally 'a movement of air, then also breath, 
soul, spirit, 'a simple essence, devoid of all, or 
at least of all grosser, matter, and possessed of the 
power of knowing, desiring, deciding, and acting”. 

From *the vital principle by which the body is ajiimated^ 
to the Holy Spirit, third person of the Christian 
conception of the Trinity, it passes to ^the disposition 
of influence which fills and governs the soul of anyone 5

the efficient source of any power, affection, emotion, 

desire* ‘Nephesh* and *ruash* occupy a similar 

1 

position in Hebrew thought. 

This form of the soul-concept has its origin 
in the breath, the shadow, and various forms of sub¬ 
jective experience, such as the dream, ecstasy, 
hallucination. In a dream an ^other self* would seem 
to leave tie body. In a state of unconsciousness it 
would appear that the *soul* had left the body for 
a time. In a case of ecstasy a person would appear 
to have become *possessed* by the soul of some departed 
person. An *other self* certainly would seem to be 
a very real entity in the case of an hallucination. 
Under the influence of fear, any strange noise, 
colour, or movement would tend to stir up vivid 
pictures of some’ soul or ghost. It is thus that 
spirits, ghosts, *Gespenster* came into being* 

Sensory stimuli revive the memory picture of dead 
persons. Thus it is that the scared individual hears 
the rattling of gruesome chains in a haunted house. 
Memory images become coloured by the individuals 
emotional experience. The fear-filled individual 
hears and sees his ovm feelings into the perceived 
objects. The more vaguely and dimly that an object 
or person, real or imaginary, is seen or heard, the 


1. Ps. 104, 29 







81 


more intensely vivid does the imagination create the 
children of fancy. Dark forests, dismal caves, 
empty, dark houses become peopled with horrible spirit 
beings, the creations of human fear exciting the 
imagination. ^‘Gruppen von Geistern sausen durch the 
Luft^% as the innocent breeze carries the clouds 
through the sky or rustles the leaves in the forest. 
Inanimate nature becomes highly sensitized and animated. 

The *psuche* idea of the soul, having its 
origin in dreams and other subjective experiences, 
greatly facilitated the spiritualization and dis¬ 
embodying process of the soul concept. 

The psyche-coneept accounts psychologically 
for strange customs and practices among primitive 
peoples, practices which survive even at the cultural 
level. The breath leaves the soul at death. To 
preserve it, a living person must receive it. The 
same desire which gives birth to the *psyche^ also 
nurses and seeks to preserve it. Hence^ a child or 
near relative bends over the face of a dying man, to 
receive and preserve his soul. The Indian medicine 
man laid his hands on the breast of the dying, or 
on his face, then placed them on the face of a living, 
at the same time blowing through his cupped hands. 
Practices intended to facilitate the escape of the 










82 


soul from the dying body become a matter of filial 
duty among the Romans. Under the influence of fear, 
Central Europeans still are known to open the window 
when someone dies to help the soul to escape, and 
thus to be rid of this dreaded being. Vi/here men 
observe the practice of closing the mouth or the eyes 
of the dying there is an obvious instance of hiding 
the real motives for a superstitious practice. "Eine 
absichtliche Verheimlichung der wahren Motive wenn 
man sich zu schaemen anfaengt." 

When the *psyche^ leaves the body and begins 

to migrate, she becomes metamorphosed, in case she 

is feared, into demons of sickness, storms, and other 

disaster-bringing phenomena. The kiss has its origin 

in the idea of soul-fusion through the breath. This 

is particularly obvious among tne Lapps and Eskimo 

who kiss by contacting the noses. This sheds light, 

1 

too, on the report that *the Lord God formed man of 
the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils 
the breath of life; cind man became a living soul.* 

The animating life principle here comes from the 
source of lifer God. And possibly it helps us to 
understand why Jesus * breathed on his disciples and 
said unto them: Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whosoever 

1. Gen, 2,7. 









83 


sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever 

1 

sins ye retain they are retained.' Magical practices 
by means of the breath are common among primitive 
peoples. Magicians have sought to create rain by 
coughing at, spitting at^or crying out at the clouds. 
When someone sneezes, the Germans say: Gesundheit! 
Evidently they believed that the sickness demon had 
been blown out. 

Due to spatial association the teeth even 
become integrated with this concept of the soul. Vifundt 
holds that strange and unnatural teeth filing and 
teeth-pulling practices have their origin atthis point. 

Funeral rites invariably have their origin 
in one of two attitudes toward the souls of the dead: 

One is the desire to preserve the vital part of the dead 
and to assimilate his powers; the other, to protect 
the living against the souls of the dead. Burial and 
cremation rites are attributed to the latter atti¬ 
tude. Mummification and embalming owe., their origin 
to the former. However, even burial would seem to 
have been considered a special favour to the dead, 
even as non-burial was considered, among the Hebrews, 
for instance, as a disgrace and a punishment. "The 
eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to 
obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick

it out, and the young eagles shall eat it." 

Y/ings of angels and the dove as representa¬ 
tive of the Holy Ghost are thus also psychologically 

accounted for. "And all averred I had killed the 

2 

bird that made the wind to blow". V/hy should such 
power be attributed to the albatross, a great white 
bird? AÄgel representations, wherever found, almost 
invariably have the wings of great birds. Why should 
that be? The (devil usually has the wings of a bird 
that flits about in the dark. How come? As the body- 
soul concept readily became associated with the 
‘Seelenwurm', and thence, by association based on 
similarity of appearance, with serpents, fish, and 
finally also with other animals which came to serve 
as totems, so the psyche-concept of the soul came to 
be associated by the 'mythenbildende Phatansie* with 
anything moving about in mid-air, lightly and fleet- 
ingly, such as birds, butterflies, storks, etc. The 
smoke ascending from the funeral pyre would readily 
lend itself to associate the psyche-concept of the 
soul with clouds. This no doubt explains the fact 
that the Roman 'auguria celestia' depended almost 
exclusively on the flight and the cry of birds. In 
the birds the prophets saw the spirits of the ancestors

whom they regarded still as the exponents of wisdom 
and sound advice in days of danger and distress, or 
when about to undertake something very important* 

Nature phenomena would tend gradually to modify such 
soul-concepts. We can see thus how a distant inter¬ 
stellar region came to be regarded as the home of 
souls and later elaborations of the soul-concept: 
angels and gods. Where the association by similarity 
in appearance between a worm and a fish obtained, 
the further association of a ship as carrying the 
souls into an abode on a distant *Isle of the Blest* 
is readily traced. Evidence for the gradual fusion 
of such elements is found by Wundt in a sample of 

primitive art depicting a * soul-ship * found among 

1 

North American Indians. Lions and horses, associated 

in life with heroes and heroic deeds, come thus also, 

in primitive art to have wings. 

“Wenn im spaeteren Altertum der Schmetterling 
als Sinnbild der suni Lichte emporstrebenden 
Psyche, die in sich zurueckgewundene Schlange 
als: solches der Unsterblichkeit, und endlich 
im Christentum die Taube als das Zeichen des 
ueber die Gemeinde sich ergiessenden Heiligen 
Geistes gilt, so sind diese Endstationen des 
Weges, den Schlange und Vogel als die spezi¬ 
fischen Seelentiere zurueckqelegt haben, 
freilich weit entfernt von ihren Ausgangspunk¬ 
ten. Schwerlich haetten sie aber entstehen 
koennen, wenn sie nicht durch eine, wenn 
auch noch so verdunkelte Heihe von Vorstellungen, 
mit jenen Anfaengen, wo die Seele wirklich 
als ain Murm aus dem Koerper des Menschen 
Kriecht and ein Vogel seine Seele emportraegt, 
zusammenhingen.” 

1. P.158,Fig.55, Voelkerpsychologie,Vol, 4,3. 

2. Ibid*, p. 161. 










- 86 - 

By a process of 'associative apperception* 
the soul-idea thus becomes readily associated with 
various kinds of animals. In some instances those 
are selected which inspire gruesome fear and awe, 
as mice, rats, toads, salamanders. 

'*Das rote Maeuschen das in Goethe's Faust in 
'der Walpurgisnacht der jungen Hexe aus dem 

Munde springt, ist ein echtes Stueck alten 

Seelenglautens." 1 

Thus the further tendency to deify animals, 
or at least to regard animals as the manifestation 
of deified souls, such *as the crocodile in Egypt and 
the elephant in India, is in a measure accounted for. 

Among the Greeks, Germans and the Homans the fallen 
warriors are carried to the heavenly regions on winged 
horses. The walkyrs of Nordic mythology themselves 
race through the heavenly regions on winged horses. 

Thus it is, too, thatwhere a tendency to deify 

a hero manifests itself, his origin is frequently 

traced to the union of a winged spirit-being, with 

a pure woman, as, for instance, in the case of Buddha. 

”In der christlichen Legende kehrt schliesslich 2 
das gleiche Motiv in vergeistigter Form wieder.'* 

In the early association between souls and 
various kinds of animals must be sought the explanation 
for later 'animalistic' and *totemistic* religious 
practices and beliefs. 

1. Ibid., p. 161. 

2. Ibid., p. 163. 








- 87 


Tree—deification and wood nymphs also owe their 
origin to soul-beliefs* -^mong the most primitive 
peoples the dead die alone. Often they hide away 
among the forest trees. Hence trees and forests came 
to be the abode of the spirits of the dead. This 
would tend to explain why the Germans worshipped 
underneath a spreading oak tree, bpyads and forest 
n\anphs thus came into being, Vedic writings have it 
that ^the fathers enter into the roots of. the trees.’ 

The cypress is a favorite tree on the cemetery. 

Dreams and ecstatic conditions, too, must 
be regarded as fountainheads of spiritual beings. 

Hades is a land of shadows. Homerts shadows undoubtedly 
have their origin in impressions received in dreams, 
visions, intoxicated or ecstatic conditions. Oat of 
dreams have come the ^alter ego^ concepts. ’TDem 
Naturmenschen ist das Traumbild unmittelbare Wirk¬ 
lichkeit^*^. Man at the primitive level regards 
dream-beings are absolutely real. Of course, the 
Greeks had learned to distingush between dream-beings 
and real beings. ^The cultured man sees in the continu¬ 
ing soul only the image of an individual. In the 
primitive mind man continues to live after death as 
wind, or cloud, as crawling or flying animal.’ Dream 
beings ccme into existence when unfilled wishes are 
stimulated by physiological conditions, food on the 








/ 88 / 

stomach, uncomfortable bed, etc. 

Visions, hallucinations, illusions likewise 
form a *fons et origo^ of spiritual beings. When we 
look for the springs and the lakes which form the 
head waters of the great stream of thought known as 
»■spiritualism' and when we look for the rivulets and 
brooks that form, by their confluence, the waters 
that make up the god-idea-stream, we shall, if we 
are not too soon satisfied that we have discovered 
THE fountainhead of that river, discover that many 
springs and perennial fountains have,-and possibly 
still do-^ contributed toward those waters, i^ong 
them weäiall find ecstatic and related subjective 
conditions of the human consciousness. In a vision 
or trance an individual feels that he is dealing with 
another, though non-material, being. The individual 
feels himself carried away to a place distant in place 
and tim.e,' The individual feels himself 'exalted*, 
'lifted into a third if not a seventh heaven'. Fever, 
alcohol, as in bionysian cult« or opium and tobacco 
may provide the sensory stimuli tor such emotional 
and visionary escapades. Ecstatic, if not frantic, 
dancing, orgiastic cults, may help to bring about 
such a condition. At this point we observe for the 
first time that not only fear and awe enter into the 
picture as originating and modifying factors, but joy 







- 89 - 


and pleasurable feeling's begin to make their contribu¬ 
tion toward the creation of spirit beings and spiritual 
modes of existence. The visionary ecstatic feels 
himself lifted up into a higher and more care-free 
quality of existence. Once the ecstatic awakens, he 
tends to place that kind of an existence into the 
future and thus ecstatic experiences become the fountain 
head of an * other world*^ the home of the sainted dead, 
the angels and god. Ecstasy proves itself *ein 
Hauptmotiv religioeser Entwickelung' . 

V/ishes, desires, hopes, aspirations also 
enter in as creative and modifying factors of spiritual 
beings in day-dreams and prophecies. Individual and 
national considerations may give direction to the 
semi-ecstatic visions of highly sensitive men. The 
true prophet as we find him in the history of Israel 
believes himself carried away by a power outside of 
himself. Stimulated by his social, political and 
economic environment, the true prophet feels himself 
in touch with a power greater than himself, and gives 
inspired expression to the felt sentiments and ideas 
of the God with whom he feels himself one. Dream 
interpretations belong, therefore, also to the pre¬ 
rogatives of those who have seen God and are in com— 
mugiion with him, -ftpocalytic writings have their origin 
1. Vol IV. I Teil-Mythus and Religion:Wundt.

in dream visions coloured by the wishes of the prophet. 

If the first spiritual beings were the souls 
of dead ancestors, how shall we account for such 
horrible-looking demoniacal spirit beings as we find 
them expressed in the primitive art of American Indians 
Chinese, Hindu, or Greek and Homan? They are a modi¬ 
fication, or better, a deformation of the soul-concept, 
due to inward and external disturbances in uhe sense 
of touch. ”Sie sind eine Folge der gesteigerten 
erregbarkeit der peripheren und zentralen öinnes- 
apparate.*’ Difficulty in breathing during the sleep 
may react on tne heart action, and hindered heart 
action may again re-act on tne feelings, fhus per¬ 
secuting, tq*oublesome nightdemons, often horrible in 
appearance, come into being. The strange being may 
take possession of the body. Vvundt calls them 
* Angsttraeume^. The ’incubus, if male, and the 
*^succubus', if female, met with in the temple dreams

may later, of course, be further aeveloped consciously 
by the artistic fancy. So-called 'alp-drearns *, in 
which the dreamer fancies himself burdened and crushed 
by some huge giant-like monster, also have their ex¬ 
planation in disturbances of one or the other of the 
sense organs. Such creatures as appear, for instance, 
in the Werwolf myth, in the legends of Heracles, of 
Prometheus, Sisyphos and the Danaidsj in Shinese 
religious art, in Greek Temple decorations, undoubtedly 
also have, in part at least, been created by the sense 
of fear, stimulated by sensory disturbances. The 
dreamers* own feelings as well as his features thus 
become embodied in his mental dream aind nightmare 
creations.

have the common characteristic that they are individual 
entities* When souls cease to be individual, they 
become ghosts. A ghost, if we are to take Wundt*s 
definition of it, is an 'aussermenschliches Wesen*. 

Of course, the ghost (Geist) may, under certain cir¬ 
cumstances become personified again, as when for 
instance it appears at night to scared individuals 
in the vicinity of the cemetery. Also, the impersonal 
ghost may possess an individual. In such expressions 
as ’he is possessed by a spirit*,’the spirit was 
poured out upon him*, ’the outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit*, Wundt sees instances in which the impersonal 
*ghost* does become individualized again. 

"That is the form of the soul-concept and the 
stage of develppment at which it has remained 
to our present level of culture.” 1 

The further development of the original soul-concept 
can be traced into modern thought and into the realm 
of philosophical thinking under the names of Geist, 
Spiritus, esprit, spirito, pneuma, nous, logos. At 
this latter stage it becomes an all'pervading prin¬ 
ciple. In this form Christian theology owes to it 
not a small part of its doctrinal concepts.

became objects to be dreaded., they emerged as 'demons*. 

1 

In Homer ‘daimon' and ^theos* are still identical. 

I'he a djective 'daimonios' gradually takes on the connota¬ 
tion of ‘having evil intentions*. Ho doubt various 
types of night-mare-like dreams helped to give shape 
to dreaded demons. At the level of Christian theology 
the demon-idea found perhaps its highest expression 
in concepts of ‘devil*, *satan* and his wicked angels. 

Tlius we see that everywhere, autochthoni- 
cally, man project« himself into objects or into beings 
that are the creations of his own 'mythological 
apperception*. Using the raw material supplied by the 
memory of sense experience, he synthesizes and fuses 
these psychical elements in sudh a way that these 
creations of his own mind invariariably mirror his 
own emotions, his hopes and his fears, his loves and 
his hate. Always he 'feels himself into* objects of 
creatures of his *^ mythenbildende Phantasie .**^ Thus 
the ^tinfuehlung'must be regarded as the matrix of all 
mythological conceptions.

Chapter Four? Heroes and the Hero-Element in the 

God-conceptT ~ ~ 

When we go in quest of the origin of god— 
ideas and taJce as our guide such eminent investiga¬ 
tors as Mueller, tapencer, Tylor, Lang, or Dürkheim, 
we shall find ourselves confronted with the problem 

t 

of making a choice among various alternatives. We 
then must needs decide for ourselves whether natural 
phenomena, or dreams and visions, or society itself, 
or overt activities,, form the original nucleus out 
of which god-ideas have been evolved. Not so when 
we follow Wundt. He reminds us that a great stream 
may have many head-waters and that it is made up of 
a confluence of many rivulets and rivers. We are 
thus spared the difficulty of making a choice among 
the many possible hypotheses on the origin of the 
god-idea. He suggests that gods appeared on the scene 
at a comparatively high level of human mental develop¬ 
ment and that they represent a fusion, a new synthetic 
creation. He postulates that the soul-idea in its 
two forms, as body-soul and as psyche, subsequently 
developing into demon-ideas, are indeed the earliest 
and oldest elements in the god-idea and that certainly 
hero-ideas form an important element in the conception 
of gods. Most investigators fail to recognize the 
important part that hero-worship has played in the 
development of the worship of gods. Heroes have much 












95 


in common with gods, but there are very distinct 
marks of difference between heroes and gods, '^hese 
are of a qualitative nature. Heroes are worshipped 
at a level of cultural, political, and economic 
development when gods have not yet made their appear¬ 
ance. True, an individual hero may develop into a 
god and vice versa a god may develop into a mere hero, 
even as a demon may become the nucleus of a god or 
a god become degraded into a mere demon, as in the 
case of the god of a conquered people. Yet, there 
are ^sehr bestimmte Unterschiede* between heroes 
and gods^ Of course, even the hero-idea has gone 
through stages of development. Thus Homer distinguished 
between *aner* (man) and ’heroes* (hero) and indicates 
that the latter is already a sort of half-god. Hut 
even so, a hero is a human entity and not a god. 

Particularly with regard to the place 
where he dwells and is active and with regard to 
the duration of his existence, a hero is not yet 
a god. ^ hero has his abode here on earth. His 
struggles, his successes take place on ‘terra firmk’. 
When at times he does venture beyond his proper 
sphere, he encounters not infrequently thB wrath 
of the gods. Gods, on the other hand, dwell in 
distant lands where no man hath trodt on high moun¬ 
tains, in the heavenly regions, on distant islands, 



•i.O'.t 








96 


beneath the earth. When gods, in exceptional cases, 
come to dwell among men, it is to be helpers and 
saviours. Human wishes and needs for food, and pro¬ 
tection, as well as man^s need for deliverance from 
evil, and peace of mind, bring the gods near to man. 
These cause them to become incarnated. Human needs 
are the psychological explanation for ^gods becoming 
manifest in the flesh*. 

Heroes have not yet attained immortality. 

They are not yet immune to the aging process. They 
are still subject to sickness. They have not con¬ 
quered death. When a hero is taken, at the end of 
his career, into the abode of the gods, he really 
ceases to be a hero. Gods, on the other hand, live 
in supra-mundane security. They are at ease. They 
do not age nor do they die. Immortality is a distin¬ 
guishing mark of the gods. Of course, V7here gods come 
in conflict either with each other or with heroes, 
they tend to become subject to human laws of existence. 
Special food and drink help to place gods above ordin¬ 
ary mortals. Where for one reason or another such 
food and drink is not available, gods begin to share 
the fate of ordinary mortals. Only in the case of 
a god of agriculture does the god have to die, after 
the analogy of the seed that is cast in the ground. 











- 91 - 


But like the seed, ao also the goa who has died, cone s 

forth again into a new life. Generally speaking, 

a hero lacks the ^aaimon^ element which forms an 

important element in the god-concept. 

’*The hero, to a greater extent even than the 
god, is the complete opposite of the demon. 

For the hero is an idealized man. He is sub¬ 
ject to all human destinies, to sickness and 
death, to afflictions of the soul, and to 
violent passions. Yet in all these instances 
the experiences are of a more exalted nature 
than in the case of ordinary human life; but 
it is just because the hero is the ideal man 
himself that he possesses all the more markedly 
the attribute which the demon lacks, namely, 
personality . This, of course, does not pre¬ 
vent his character from exhibiting generic 
differences and antitheses. But herein also 
the hero is only the idealized counterpart 
of man, for, despite all its uniqueness hnd 
individuality, man's character usually con¬ 
forms to certain types. Thus, legend intro¬ 
duces the strong, all-conquering hero, and, 
in contrast with him, the hero who is resource¬ 
ful and overcomes his enemies through subtle 
conning. It tells of the aged man, superior 
in wisdom and experience, and also of him who, 
in the unbrqken strength of youth and with 
stormy passion, overthrows all opponents. 

It further portrays the hero who plots evil, 
but who is nevertheless characterized by a 
sharply defined personality.” 1 

This individual personality of the hero 
and its contribution to the development of the god- 
idea sheds valuable light on the problem of poly¬ 
theism. In discussing the probable explanation for 

1. Elements of Folk Psychology, 1912, Wundt. 










98 


a multiplicity of gods, some have held that the develop¬ 
ment of the god-idea proceeded along a uniform line 
from momentary gods, to gods of longer duration and 
ending in an eternal God. They would make the time 
element the predominant characteristic mark of progress.. 
Others have sought to make space tlB predominant element 
and have sought to trace the growth of the god-idea 
from many local gods to a universal, all-comprehensive 
God. As man's own mental horizon was extended by 
travel and intercourse, his gods tended to become 
more universal. Thus a monotheism was finally arrived 
at. There is an element of truth in both theories. 

Both fail, however, in stating the whole truth of 
the matter. For one thing, the individual personaliti’es 
of the heroes have been perpetuated in the ideas of 
god. And, what is of still greater significance, 
man has a variety of psychical needs, not to mention 
physical needs, which call for a multiplicity of gods 
to supply those needs. It is this m^ultiplicity of 
needs as well as individual human differences that 
help to account for ^he strange co-existence of 
polytheism and monotheism even at a stage of culture 
when one would not expect to see any remains of the 
former. 

”It is the hero v^/ho gives to the gods those 
very characteristics which the demon lacks 
from the outset. Of these, the most important 




















- 99 


are personality, self-consciousness, and a 
will controlled by diverse and frequently 
conflicting motives, ihis multiplicity of 
motives has a close connection with the multi- 
plicity of gods. Polytheism is not an accidental 
feature which may or may not accompany the 
belief in gods; it is a necessary transitional 
stage in the development of the god-idea. 'Folk- 
belief, v^hich never frees itself entirely from 
mythology, always retains a plurality of 
divine beings. Hence true monotheism represents 
a philosophical development of the god-idea. 
Though this development was not without 
influence on the theological speculation which 
was dominated by traditional doctrines, it 
was never able to uproot the polytheistic 
tendency involved in the god-idea from the 
very beginning. There are two sources from 
which this tendency springs. Of these, one 
is external and, therefore, though of great 
importance for the beginnings of religious 
development, is transitory. It consists in 
the influence exerted by the multiplicity of 
natural phenomena, through the nature myth, 
upon the number of gods. More important and 
of more permanent significance is the second 
or internal motive, namely, the fact that the 
psychical needs that come to expression in 
the demand for gods are numerous* There cannot 
be a single god-ideal any more than a single 
type of hero. On the contrary, as heroes 
exhibit the diversity of human effort on an 
exalted plane, so, in turn, does the realm of 
gods represent, on a still higher level, 
the world of heroes.” 1 

The similarity between a god and his wor¬ 
shippers is obvious. Equally obvious is the similarity 
between a people's social conditions as they exist 
actually here-and now and a postulated heaven or hell. 
One might be tempted therefore to hold that gods are 
an other-worldly reproduction of prominent members 
1. Ibid% p; 371 












- 100 - 


of the social group, that a heaven is a reproduction 
in another world of the agreeable side of social 
life here and now, and that a' hell is but an other¬ 
worldly reproduction of the disagreeable and undesir¬ 
able aspect of social life. Some inquirers into 
the subject have brought forward that thesis. Here 
again, we have an element of truth but not the whole 
truth. As a heaven is an intensified and idealized 
existence for those whose attitudes and conduct have 
met with general approval, and as hell is an inten¬ 
sified existence of pain for those whose attitudes 
and conduct are socially disapproved of, so also 
with the heroes and the gods.. A hero is an idealized 
social or political leader* And a god is an idealized 
hero. A hero, even as a god, is a being as his adorers 
wish him to be. Hence the appropriateness of referring 
to heroes and gods as projected wishes, externalized 
hopes and aspirations. CWunschwesen). 

”When we survey these various-heroic figures 
in both their generic and their individual 
aspects and compare them with the god-personalities 
we are struck by the fact that the god was 
not created directly in the image of a man, 
but rather in that of a hero,man idealized. 

It is the hero v/ho gives to the gods those 
very characteristics which the demon lacks 
from the outset.*^ 1 

Personality, individuality, and amenability, 

these are among the traits of a god which it inherited 

from the hero. The anthropomorphic nature of the

gods was taken over from the ideal man. The idea 
that man can enter into social relations with a god 
is a remnant from that age of hero worship in which 
powerful spiritual beings were considered not essent— 
ially different,, only greater and more powerful, 
from man himself. If we would know how men came to 
believe that gods could be persuaded to change their 
mind and their ways in answer to man’s pleadings we 
must hearken back to the time when men worshipped 
heroes* 

Omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, 

spirituality, these are traits of the god-concept 

which it inherited from the *daimon^ concept. The 

union of the two elements, demon and^^To^, brought 

into existence the gods. 

”The advance beyond the hero-ideal becomes 
possible to the mythological-imagination only 
because the very endeavour to exalt the hero 
above the himan itself brought the hero-idea 
at the very time of its origin, into connection 
with the demon idea. For the demon is a 
super-human being, magic-working and un¬ 
predictable, affecting in mysterious ways 
the course of nature and of human destiny. 

Blit it lacks the familiar human traits which 
make the hero an object not only of fear but 
aJ^o of admiration and love. Thus, the fusion 
of hero and demon results in the final and 
the greatest of mythological creations, the 
conception which represents the birth of re¬ 
ligion in the proper and ultimately only true 
sense of the word. I refer to two (component 
factors. One of these, the demoniacal, has 
had a long history, extending back to the 
beginnings of mythological thought; the 
other, the heroic, begins to assert itself 
the very moment that the figure of the hero 









- 102 


appears. This implies that god-ideas are 
neither of sudden origin nor unchangeable, 
but that they undergo a gradual development. 

— The earliest god-ideas are predominantly 
demoniacal in nature — personal characteristics 
are few, while magical features are all the 
more pronounced. Then the heroic elements 
come to the fore, until they finally acquire 
such dominance that even the magical power 
of the gods appears to be a result of his 
heroic might, rather than a survival of the 
demoniacal nature which was his from the very 
beginning.p 1 

The contribution of hero-ideas toward the 
anthropomorphic elements in the god-idea manifests 
itself at various points. Obviously, the idea that 
Zeus is the father of gods and men, as also the con¬ 
ception of the Fatherhood of God, have their begin¬ 
nings in ideas of heroic superiority of the father 
of the tribe and race. God as ruler of the nation, 
more especially, has its roots in the strong leader¬ 
ship of national heroes. The existence of a *pantheon* 
which rairrors political conditions here upon earth, 
likewise tends to show that god-ideas have absorbed 
hero-ideas and that hero-concepts have become as¬ 
similated in later god-ideas. 

**That gods belong essentially to the heroic 
age appears also in the fact that the divine 
realism mirrors in detail the relations of 
political society developed subsequently to 
the beginning of the heroic age. The world 
of gods likewise forms a divine State. It 
is at most at an early period that the tribal 
gods of various peoples betray the influence 
of the ancient tribal organization that pre¬ 
ceded the State. In the supremacy of a 
single god, however, the idea of rulership, 


:b id 


r- 


372 














) 


i 

i 



- 103 


which is basal to the State, is transferred 
also to the divine realm* Ihis is true whether 
the ruling deity exercises command over a 
subservient host of demons and subordinate 
gods, hr whether he has at his dide a number 
of independent gods, who reprt sent, in part, 
an advisory council, such as is found associated 
with the early rulers, and, in part, since 
the different gods possess diverse powers, a 
sort of celestial officialdom*'* 1 

And thus did actual rulers, kings, heroes, 

highly idealized in a hero-worshipping age, contribute 

toward the development of the idea that God is a ruler 

of the nations, ruler of the universe, king of kings* 

Closely related to the conception of god 

as king, is the idea of God as judge who will call 

on all to give an account of themselves and who will 

apportion to each his just award. This aspect of 

the god-idea has continued to come very much into 

the foreground particularly in literature of an 

apocalyptic nature, also of the Christian era* 

The idea that god is the author of a 

standardized code of morals is very common* God is 

regarded as the author of customs and moral laws* 

He rewards those who are obedient and punishes those 

who are recalcitrant. He provides the necessary 

sanctions for rules of conduct. It is not difficult 

to trace these elements in the god-idea to a time 

when admired and respected leaders in the social 

group, patriarchs, rulers, kings, tyrants, did actually

make laws and provided the necessary motives for 
submission to such laws. 

Chapter Five ^yths (Maerchen, sag:a, le5?ends% cosmogonies ^ 

^beogonies, apocal^ipses) as factors 

in the development of demon- hero«- 

and god-ideas» 

We may at this place call attention to the 
manner in which various elements of demon-ideas and 
hero-ideas tended to become associated and assimilated 
in the formation of god-ideas. Ihe important role 
played by stories and story-telling in this syn¬ 
thesizing process is a matter of constant interest 
to Wundt. In fact, he regards the three distinctly 
diffoment types of stories, the ^Maerchen* of the 
primitive mentality, the •saga* of the hero-worshipping 
type of mentality, and the *legend* of the god- 
worshipping type of mentality, as the three layers 
of rocks, as it were, in which the fossil remains of 
man’s mental evolution can be found. 

Even at the primitive level of mentality 
a hero makes his appearance in the myths (Maerchen) 
characteristic of that age. The Maerchen-hero, the 
ancestor or pre-cursor of the saga-hero, is usually 
a wonder-working boy who does things with magician¬ 
like dexterity. The demon- and magic-element is 
very strongly represented in the typical Maerchen-hero. 














105 - 


The saga-hero is more consistently human* ‘i'he anthro¬ 
pomorphic element comes to be pre-dominant. He is 
usually a strong and young individual who is less a 
magician and more truly a real human hero. Hercules, 
for instance, is not a magician. ’J-he Argonauts, 
are heroes, not magicians. An awakening critical 
judgment tends to make the hero at least possible 
even if not actually historical. The heroes of the 
Odyssey are human. In the saga of Troy it is quite 
possible that actual historical incidents have been 
interwoven in the folk tale. Siegfried of Hibelungen 
fame is at least historically possible. St. George, , 
the dragon-killer, has more of the ^Macrchen' traits 
in it. The saga of the hero-age reveal a less gul¬ 
lible and a more critical mentality. 

^ow did the idea of hero arise? Was it a 
free and completely new creation of this 
age based merely on observations of individuals 
wha were paragons of human ability? Or did 
it have precursors in the totemic era? As a 
matter of fact, this second question must be 
ansered in the affirmative. The hero was 
not unknown in the preceding age. At that 
time, however, he was not a hero in the speEific 
sense which the word first acquired in the 
herl)#c age; on the contrary, he was a Maerchen- 
hero, if we may use the word *hero^ in con¬ 
nection with the concepts of this earlier 
period. On the threshold of the heroic age, 
the Maerchen-hero changes into the hero proper. 
The former represents the central theme of the 
earlier form of the myth narrative, the maerchen- 
myth, as does the hero that of the developed 
form, the saga* The markd that distinguish 
the Maerchen-hero, as he still survives in the 












106 - 


children*s tales, from the hero of saga, are 
important ones and are fraught with signifi¬ 
cance for the development of the myth as a 
whole* The Maerchen-hero is usually a child* 

In the form in which he gradually approximates 
to the hero proper, he is more especially 
as a rule, a boy who goes forth into the world 
and meets with adventures* In these adven¬ 
tures he is aided by various powers of magic, 
which he either himself possess or which are 
imparted to him from without by magical beings* 
— Magic plays a decisive role in his destiny; 
his own cunning and skill may be co-operating 
factors, but they rarely determine the out¬ 
come* Not so the hero of the saga. This 
hero is not a boy, but a man* The favourite 
theme of the s aga is a young man in the bloom 
of his life. In his acts,"moreover, this 
hero is dependent, for the most part, on 
himself* True, he, as the Maerchen-hero, is 
familiar with magic and miracle, but it is 
primarily by his own power that he overcomes 
the hostile forces that oppose him* A sug¬ 
gestive illustration is that of Hercules, that 
figure of Greek saga who is preeminently the 
typical hero among the most diverse peoples 
and in widely different ages* Hercules is 
aa entirely self-dependent hero* — He is 
not a magician, but a being of transcendent 
power and strength*** 1 

Gradually, with the development of the humab 

mentality, the magical element in mythology tends to 

th© 

disappear* The saga takes^place of the maerchen* 
Historically possible and actual historical elements 
become incorporated in the folk stories* Cultural 
progress is mirrored in the saga of a people. The 
development of a critical attitude tends to eliminate 
the absurd and unbelievable from the folk tales* 


1* Ibid*, fp* 375-6

This is a point persistently pointed to by Martin 
Nilsson in his ”The History of the Greek Religion*" 
The development of the maerchen into a saga and the 
saga into what tends to become objective history is 
an especial contribution of the ^eek mind to the 
development of human mentality. Hand in hand with 
this development goes, of course, the development of 
a maerchen-hero into the saga-hero, thence into an 
anthropomorphic god and finally into a non-personal 
power. 

"Though the hero saga resembles the maerchen 
in the :fact that it grows by the agglutination 
of diverse legendary materials, it differs 
from it in the possession of a characteristic, 
which iJb typical of this stage of develop¬ 
ment. That which binds together the separate 
elements of the hero saga is the unitary 
thought, generally associated with cultural 
changes or with historical events. 

"In the course of the development, the heroic 
elements gradually increased; the maerchen 
ideas, on the other hand, disappeared, except 
when some poet intentionally selected them for 
the enrichment of his tale, as was obviously 
done by the author of the Odyssey." 1 

With the development of the human conscious¬ 
ness a growing inwardness became evident. Spiritual 
values came gradually to take their place alongside 
of material-values. Moral enemies, moral battles, 
moral victories and heroes gradually came to play 
a prominent part in the life of man. The enemy within 

had to be conquered. *Vincit qui se vincit*.

the development of the ethical cons (piousness came 
a sin-consciousness. Hence arose the need for a re¬ 
deeming and a sanctifying heroic helper. This felt 
need resulted in the development of a special type 
of hero-saga^ the religious legend. 

"An important intermediate phenomenon is not 
infrequently f'ound in a specific form of myth 
whose general nature is that of the hero-saga, 
even though it is usually distinguished from 
the latter because of the character of its 
heroes. I refer to the religious legend. 

Some of these legends, such as the Buddha, the 
Mithra and the Osiris legends, border upon the 
deity saga. Nevertheless, the religious legend, 
as exemplified also in the mythological versions 
of the life of Jesus, represents an offshoot 
of the hero-saga, springing up at those times 
when the religious impulses are dominant. 

That ilt is a hero-saga is evidenced particularly 
by the fact that it recounts the life and deeds 
of a personality who is throughout exalted 
above the human stature, but who, nevertheless, 
attains divinity only through his striving, 
his suffering and his final victory. In so 
far, the religious hero very closely resembles 
the older class of heroes. Nevertheless, 
instead of the hero of the heroic age, pre¬ 
eminent for his external qualities, iie have 
the religious hero who is exalted by his inner 
worth into a redeeming god. But it is only 
because these divine redeemers fought and 
conquered as men - a thing that would be 
impossible to gods proper who are exalted from 
the beginning in supra-mundane glory - that 
they constitute heroes of saga, in spite of 
the fact that they fought with wther weapons 
and in other ways than the heroes of the heroic 
age. And, therefore, none of these redeemer 
personalities, whether they have an historical 
background, as have Jesus and Buddha, or 
originate entirely in the realm of mythological 
imagination, as in the case of Osiris and 
Mythra, belong to the realm of the saga once 
they are elevated into deitives. Even Buddha

return in the endless sequence of ages is not 
to be regarded as an exception to this rule, for 
the hope of salvation here merely keeps pro¬ 
jecting into the future the traditional Buddha 
legend. l‘he redeeming activity of the one who 
is exalted into a god, is to be repeated in 
essentially the same manner as the saga 
reports it to have occurred in the past.” 1 

•^‘hus we see 

**es ist vor allem die historische Heldensage, dis 
die Goetter in dem Masse menschen-aehnlicher 
macht als sie aus der eignen isphaftre mensch¬ 
lichen Tuns,, das uebermenschliche Wunder 
verschwinden laesst. Indem sie aber dieses den 
Goettern zu teilt, erhebt sie dieselben, waeh- 
rend sie sie vermenschlicht, gleichzeitig zu 
uebermenschlichen Wesen, zu denen der Mensch 
in der Hot seine Zuflucht nimmt, und deren 
Hilfe er durch Opfer und Gebet erringen kann* 

So entwickelt sich das Bild des Gottes. 

— Der Held der Sage mit allen ihn ueber dass 
Mittelmass der Menschen erhebenden und dennoch 
rein menschlichen Eigenschaften ist das Urbild 
des persoenlichen Gottes. ” 2 

The magical power of the maerchen-hero does 

entirely disappear in the saga-hero and especially 

not in the hero of the religious legend. It emerges 

again in the miracle-working powers of that hero. 

”Der niedrige Zauber der irdischen Daemonen und 
zauberkundigen Menschen hat dem ueber die 
gewaltigen Kraefte der Natur gebietenden, an 
keine menschliche Schranken gebundenen 
goettlichen WUNDER Platz gemacht.“ ”So vol¬ 
lendet die Heldensage in der üebertragung des 
des Characters der Persoenlichkeit von einer 
der bedeutsamsten Seiten her die Ausbildung der 
Goettervorstellungen.“ 3 

In taking over the elements of magic and 

miracle the religious legend tends, however, to dis-

tinguish itself more and more from another type of 
folk-tale, the one which emerges finally as objective 
history. The hero of the religious legend thus con¬ 
tinues to dwell in a halo of jimythical elements v;hile 
the characters of history tend to become progressively 
^historical* in the degree in which historians succeed 
in reaching their objective of portraying men realis¬ 
tically, 

**As god-ideas assimilate elements of magic and 
miracle a |)rogressive differentiation of the 
deity-saga and the hero-saga takes place. Here 
we have the beginning of two important modes 
of cultural transmission. One becomes history. 
The other, beginning with the religious legend 
integrates with itself originally disparate 
elements of the *0rstsage*, the * Lokalkultus • 
and demon concepts, evolves into religious 
tradition,” 1 

Cosmogonic myths have been an important 
medium for the development of the conception that 
God is the creator of heaven and earth. The Genesis 
record begins with the statement: *In the beginning 
God created heaven and earth* , •‘•he statement of faith 

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven 

I 

and Earth, is held in common by practically all con¬ 
fessional units in Christendom, Creation stories 
are found among practically all peoples of all times#

^ny attempt even today to eliminate God from the 
creative process of the mniverse is met with emotionally- 
coloured opposition* Even the evolutionary hypothesis, 
though at first largely mechanistic, has attempted to 
adjust itself to the desire to retain god as the 
creator and has therefore postulated an emergent 
evolution, an hypothesis in which god as creator is 
given a tolerably honorably place* 

Cosmogonic myths are of comparatively late 
origin according to Wundt. In its earliest stage of 
development this type of myth was but a crude attempt 

I 

|to account for the origin of the world and man* It 
represented,also, an attempt to account for the origin 
of cultural blessings. At the earliest level the 
world was believed to have developed either out of a 
huge egg, a lotus bud, or a cocoanut* Locally observed 
natural phenomena have in each case contributed toward 
the nature of the myth. Usually the myth attempts to 
give an account of the progress from chaos to order, 
from darkness to light* The gradual separation of 
water areas from land areas enter into the account, 
as also the division between heaven and earth* 

Ouranos and Gea hold each other in embrace until a 
son separates them. In the Son the creator-god begins 
to emerge* Marduk cleaves Thiamata in two and thus

attributed to the gods among the peoples who developed 
astronomy. It is in the midst of such peoples (Persians) 
that 

”the creator-god ceases to be a mere crude 
divider of heaven and earth, land and sea, of 
primitive mythology and becomes the power which 
regulates the starry heaven according to 
fixed laws of numbers and times, who fixes 
the star configuration in twelve monthly units 
and makes the moon the measure of time. In 
I this great picture of a universe governed by 

I laws — the creation-saga enter upon the 

! borderland where this type of myth serves to 

I embody the beginnings of a scientific world

( 

i 

The cosmogony of Genesis was obviously 
written from the viewpoint of men who sought to glorify 
the tribal god of Israel and who were intent on pro- 
ividing effective sanctions to their code of ethics, 
jceremonial laws^as well providing an effective basis 
jand bond for tribal and national unity and cohesion. 

! Theogonic and theomachic myths likewise have 

jmade their contribution toward the development of the 
jconcept of god. For a finite mind to conceive the 

i 

jinfinite is quite impossible. I'hus even the gods, 

i 

} 

I even though of pre-historic origin, must have had a 

I 

beginning. This need for postulating a beginning even 
for the gods has found expression in theogonic myths.

I'hese are of course, closely related to the cosmogonic 

1 

myths* "In the beginning was the Word" is a late 
attempt to §olve the problem of origins aaiong the gods. 
In Hesiod, god is a man-eating monster who devours 
his own children. Rhea manages to save one son by a 
trick. Thus Zeus escapes the fate of those who are 
devoured by Time. Aphrodite traces her origin back 
to sea nymphs who were first conceived in connection 
with sea foam. 

j 

I An attempt to reconcile the contradiction 

j between theogonic ideas and the conception of god as 

Ipre-existent, non-created and eternal,emerges in the 

postulate of Christian theology according to which the 
I the 

Son is indeed born of the Father and/Holy Spirit 

proceeds from the Father and the öon, yet all three 

t 

I are co-existent and co-eternal. 

i Theomachic myths obviously mirror conflicts 

jin the atmospheric conditions, tribal and national 
wars, conflicts of cultures and more particularly 
possibly also inner, psychic conflicts. Thus the 
Cyclopes and the Titans reveal themselves as des¬ 
cendants of weather demons. They mirror atmospheric 
conflicts. A growing ethical consciousness reveals 
itself in the conflict of two opposing principles, 
of good and evil, as elaborated in the theomachic 

myths of Persia. In Christian theology the ethical

dualism expresses itself in the opposition and constauit 
warfare between god and the devil. An increasing dif¬ 
ferentiation between good and bad, right and wrong, 
manifests itself in another type of mytht Weltunter¬ 
gangsmythen. 

That aspect of a god in which he appears 
as the final arbiter in ethical questions, and more 
especially as the destroyer of the wicked and the 
final saviour of the good and obedient, finds its 

most prolific development in stories of the end of 

I 

the world. Ät times these stories relate great catas- 
I trophies of the past, as in the * Sintflut- and 

i 

I Sint brandsagen* , at other times they take on an 
I apocalyptic nature and place the cataclysmic event into 

Ithe future.

That the geographic environment of a people

I of as dealing with sinful man is particularly obvious 

i

jfrom that fact that in countries in which heavy 

I 

I seasonal rainfalls bring about catastrophic inundations 
these types of myth take on the nature of a flood, 
while in countries where rainfall is scarce and the 
hot sun as well as prairie and forest fires constitute 
major calamities, god is thought to express his wrath 
in past and future *^Sintbrande* .

“■J-'hese myths therefore, are not original myth 
creations as are the cosmogonic myths, at least 
in part. They are the product of religious 
reflection, and, as such, they are dominated 
primarily by the desire to strengthen the 
righteous in his hopes and to terrify his 
adversaries. Thus, the history of the cosmogonic 
myth here repeats itself in a peculiarly in¬ 
verted form. With the exception of occasional 
survivals, the religious iganQua, which is the 
ripest development of the cosmogonic myth, 
excludes the struggles of the demons and wild 
monsters of the deep; the myth of the destruc¬ 
tion of the world, on the other hand, constantly 
seeks, by its fantastic imagery, to magnify 
fears and punishments, as well as blessed hopes. 
Äs a result, all these accounts clearly beair 
the traces of a laborious invention seeking to 
surpass itself and thus to atone for the lack 
of original mythological imagination.'* 1 

The monsters appearing in the Book of Job, 

2 3 

Behemoth, and Leviathan, are examples of such purpose¬ 
ful exaggerations. 

In general we may observe that the cosmogonic 
and theogonic myths, as well as stories of the des¬ 
truction of the world, tend to bring to the foreground 
again the tremendous, super-human power of the gods. 

In the language of Wundt: The demon-element tends to 
pre-dominate while the heroic and personal element in 
the god-idea tends to recede in this type of mythologi¬ 
cal formations. Certainly, the gods tend to become 
more universal in their sphere of influence. Stories 
of the distant past and the distant future with gods

as chief actors tend to introduce them to a v;orld-wide 
audience and a world-wide stage, ^pace and time 
limitations are being overcome, ihe gods are thus 
coming to be more time-less and space-less. Obviously 
this development marks a progressive extension of the 
mental horizon of the devotees. It indicates a victory 
in the age-old battle against the barriers to omnis¬ 
cience, omnipresence and immortalitys:- ^pace and time. 
^^He (Christ) descended into hell -- he ascended into 
heaven^. It is in myths closely related to cosmogonic 
land cosmo-destructive myths that the idea of gods as- 
Icending into heaven, the abode of the blessed, and 
descending into hell, the abode of sat4n and his 

I 

I angels and the wicked, have found their development.

j peoples at all cultural levels that autochthonic origin

i 

may safely be postulated even though evidence of 
transference and migration are at hand. Naturally, 
soul-ideas, particularly psyche-conceptions, have made 
their contribution to the development of worlds be¬ 
yond. At an early date other-world conceptions have 
practically no ethical significance, from which we 
conclude that also gods, when they v^/ere still young, 

I lacked ethical character traits*

Originally there was only an undifferentiated 

realm of the dead. With the American Indians the 

otherworld is largely a continuation of the present* 

It is a spirit village. From observations of the 

dead, and from burial practices the ideas of the nether 

world as a place dark, dismal, cold, lifeless were 

I evolved* The Hades of the Greeks, sheol of the 

j 

I Israelites, Orkus of the Romans, Nilfheim of the 
I Teutons ,5 were largely undifferentiated reaHms of the 
dead and the rulers of these abodes had no zealous 
i interest in the moral character of his wards.

of an ethical consciousness. Those who have manifested

given a place in an after-world more desirable than 
those who lacked these marks of virtue. Thus the 
heroic warriors among the Teutons were allowed to 
enter Valhalla.

the devout and the righteous, the favoured of 
the gods; the underworld continues at the outset, 
to be the lot of the majority of human beings. 

‘-‘■he growing desire to participate in the joys 
of the blessed then causes the privilege which 
was at first enjoyed only by the minority to 
become more universal, and the underworld is 
transformed into the abode of the guilty and 
the condemned. Finally, heaven becomes possible 
also for the latter, through the agency more 
particularly, of magical purifications and 
religious ecstasy." 1 

In the myths which have to do with the other 
world the process of differentiation among the gods 
takes place. The hopes and fears, the likes and dis¬ 
likes of humans manifest themselves on the one hand 
in the distinction between realms of light and realms 
of darkness, heaven and hell, abodes of joy and abodes 
of sorrow and pain where there is weeping and gnashing 
of tbeth; on the other hand they enhance the distinction 
among powerful spiritual beings as Ormuzd and Ahriman, 
Christ and Satan. Inner moral conflicts are mirrored 
in the war of the good and evil principles. Thus it 
was written of Christ and his battle with the rulers 
of the kingdom of darknessf ^Having spoiled prin¬ 
cipalities and powers, He made a show of them openly, 

2 

triumphing over them in it." 

"From thence He shall come to judge the quick 
and the dead" 3 "This same Jesus which is 
taken up from you into heaven shall so come 
in like manner as ye have seen him go into 
heaven" 4

And 

"We must all appear before the Judgement-seat 
of Christ, that everyone may rexzeive the things 
done in His body, according to that he hath done, 
whether it be good or bad." 1 

The conception of God as a judge who is righteous 
in that he rev^ards the good and punishes evil and finally 

assigns to the souly and body, their proper eternal abode, 

other 

las found its greatest development rin ideas of the^ world. 

"In closest connection with this separation of 
realms in the underworld, is the introduction of 
judgeship. It devolves upon the judge of the under¬ 
world to determine whether the soul is to be ad¬ 
mitted to the vale of joy or to be banished into 
the Orkus, rt is significant that, in his picture 
of the underworld, Virgil entrusts this judgeship 
to the same Rhadamanthus with whom we are familiar 
from the Odyssey as the ruler of the distant island 
of the blessed." 2 

"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow 
of death, I will fear no evil? for thou are with 
me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me." 

The conception of God as a guide supplies a 
very urgent universal need. In the mythological formations 
l5earing on the other world, this element in the god-idea 
i)bviously found its development. The tSchreckensmotivt 
obviöusly contributed largely to the development of this 
:ldea. 

A remote abode. That is one of the traits of a 
god. The development of Conceptions of a distant abode of 
■:he dead, obviously tended to make the gods to dwell in .a 
distant region. Particularly when ecstatic conditions <:and 

1. 2 Cor. 5, 10. 2 , Elements, Wundt, n»403 

3. Ps, 23,4 






121 


ajid visions enter upon the scene as a contributory fac¬ 
tor, do the gods become still more distant. Thus Paul is 
privileged to see and hear God only after, in a vision, 
he has entered the third and seventh heaven. 1 

Thus it is in the ideas of the world, of hemven, 
purgatory, and hell, with its antecedent conceptions, 
that we find mirrored man^s hopes for an eternal, blessed, 
carefree existence, his fear of death, his growing sense 
of right and wrong, his widening mental horizon tending 
to overcome space and time barriers; and it is in them 
that we see the evolution of god-ideas which in turn 
reflect man’s inner life; gods who are increasingly just, 
retributive, implacable, vengeful; increasingly spiritual; 
distant, abiding in a remote heaven, the abode of the 
gods; immortal. 

It is these elements in the god-idea that 
provide the psychological necessity for the CULT and 
cult practices. For it is the particular purpose and 
function of cult practices such as sacrifices, lustrations, 
prayers, to placate the gods and to bring them near to 
man to help him in the solution of his problems. 

It is through the cult that man shares in those 

blessings which he conceives as embodied in the gods; 

power, new life, spiritual life, happiness here and 

hereafter, peace, joy, and above all eternal life; immort¬ 
ality.

Chapter Six : The Cult as a Factor in the Development of 

the God-Concept » 

We have seen that certain elements in the God-idea 
found their fullest development in an ideological set¬ 
ting? maerchen, saga, legend, religious legend and ending 
up in systems of theology and philosophy. The cult and 
cult practices have been an equally if not more important 
generating and modifying factor in the origin and develop¬ 
ment of essential elements in the god-concept. This is to 
say that activities , ceremonies, rites, liturgy, have 
been, and, it may be assumed, are still and will continue 
to be, an important part of the environment in the midst 
of which god-ideas developed and will develop. 

‘^Kultus and Sage teilen sich in der Gestaltung der 
Goetter. Der Kultus sorgt dafuer dass die Goetter 
trotz der stoerenden Einwirkungen der Sagenzuege 
als Helfer in der Hot, aber auch als furchtbare 
Raecher der Schuld und er ihnen versagten Ehrfurcht 
in Opfer und Gebet zu uebermenschlichen Wesen 
erhoben werden. Die Sage bringt sie immer und 
immer wieder dem Menschen Menschlich naeher.” ^ 

F^he discussion of the relative importance of myth 
and cult as generating and modifying factors in the develop¬ 
ment of the god-concept raises a very fundamental question 
of philosophy. It is a question of priority. Have action 
patterns produced thought patterns or have thought pat¬ 
terns produced action patterns? The opposition between , 
naturalism and idealism emerges in this question. 

The question becomes, or shall we say became, acute par-

ticulary in the field of education and more especially 
in the fielf of ethics. Is morality a matter of habit 
formation or a matter of ideological motivation? Some 
hold that we learn from books and others that we learn 
by doing. In the educational world tha latter appears 
to be on the ascendency at the present ,time, as is 
evidenced by the increase in activity schools and activity- 
and enterprise-programs in all progressive schools. In 
the field of religion and morality,too, the pre-eminence 
and priority of doing and living over against believing 
and knowing appears to find favour. The evolutionary 
hypothesis, particularly as i nterpreted in the* emergent^ 
version of it as advanced by Morgan and Alexander, 
would seem to make the body-soul, matter-spirit, physiology, 
plogy, practice-theory, cult-ideology sequence the more 
consistent with modern thought. 

Translated into terminology within the scope 
of this essay, the question presents itself thus: Did 
men learn to pray, bring sacrifices, observe rites of 
lustration and come to believe in gods because they ob¬ 
served such and similar cult activities? 

Until modern times the more or less self-evident 

answer was that certain modes of religious behaviours 

as evidenced in rites and ceremonies were the result of 

certain ideas that man had with regard to gods. However, 

with the 





- 124 - 

development of a natui*alistic and behaviouristic inter¬ 
pretation of social phenomena another theory has been 
very much in favour. Among others it was Durkheira (The 
Elementary Forms of Religious Life) who brought forward 
the thesis of the social origin of religious concepts, even 
as he held that all categories might be traced back to col¬ 
lective activities and consequent collective consciousness* 

’’Religious categories are something eminently 
social*” 1. 

”It is at the school of collective life that the 
individual has learned to idealize.” 2 

Though Dürkheim* s chief concern is to show that so- 

j ciety is the entity *sui generis* v/hich has been the ma- 

I trix of all ideas, categories, institutions, customs, and 

I 

; morals and that the gods, too, even as the social con- 

i 

1 

i 

j sciousness in general, have their origin in collective 
I life without stressing xjarticularly the idea that ideas 
have been generated in actions and habits, yet, he too, 
stresses this aspect of the problem* 

I ”The cults (common actions, active co-operation, 

! physical maneuvers) create and recreate joy, peace, 

I strength, peace, enthusiasm.” 3 

! 

I Group activities create a state of effervescence out 

I 

I of which concepts emerge* And it is the moral efficacy 

1 

i of collective activities which assign such pov/er and ef- 

j 

( 

ficiency to those beings to whom the cult' activities are

directed. 

’•Idealization is the natural product of the 
social life.” 1. 

The collective life brings about a state of effer¬ 
vescence, causing man to create an ideal world above the 
real, and, may we add, populating that world with ideal 
beings. According to Dürkheim* s view a god is the ex¬ 
ternal nucleus of a social consciousness and ’’before all, 

I rites are the means by which the social group re-affirms 

! 

i itself periodically.” 2. More especially does King (The 
I development of Religion) postulate that religious ideas 

I have grov/n out of ’overt activities* of the group. Ames 

! 

I (Religion) holds a similar theory. Thus we see that be- 
! haviourism which tends to give priority to the cults in 
I preference to the gods and which tends to give to cults a 

j creative role rather than to the gods, is a widely held 

! 

i thesis. 

I 

I By v/ay of anticipation v/e may say The problem 

! 

I tends to become irrevelant with the development of the 

i 

I Deweyan concept of ’’interaction.” In the light of this 

I 

I concept, which, by the way, is as much, if not more, Wun- 

i 

1 

i dtian as it is Dev/eyan, neither the gods nor the cult are 

i 

I given the exclusive " role of creators. Nor are they 
given the exclusive status of creatures and creations. 
Rather, each shares in the creation of the other and each

par;^akes of the nature of creations of each other, so that 
while it is true that gods have generated the cult and 
modified it, it is equally true that the cult has been an 
important factor in the generation of certain elements 
of the god-idea* 

Certain it is: '*Ohne Kultus gibt es keinen Gott"* 
True j there are (cult-less gods* They are particularly those 
powerful beings which appear in cosmogonic myths* Neverthe¬ 
less, since these beings lack an essential characteristic 
of a god, personality, these are not gods in the Wundtian 
sense of the word* Likewise, there are cults which are 
god-less, i.e., they are either not directed to any object¬ 
ive being at all, or they are directed to demon beings* 
Nevertheless, cult and god are inseparably associated. 

Cult rites which are directed to demon powers are pre¬ 
religious* 

The inter-active and mutually-modifying relation¬ 
ship of god and cult ia definitely affirmed by Wundt* 

**¥ith the development of the cult into a god-cult, 
there opens up a wide field of further possible develop¬ 
ment of a religious nature* The cult nov/ shares in 
all those developments which the god-ideas themselves 
experience. And here too the relationship becomes 
one of mutual interaction (Wechselwirkung) in the midst 
of which the exalted position of the gods re-act on 
the cult but equally so do the motives latent in the , 

cult re-act in a modifying v;ay on the god-ideas* Thus 
the gods fan d the cultl exercise a creative influence 
on the cultYmodifies the gods, or, where the existing 
religious motives do not meet the situation any more, 
create new gods* This is a power of the cult which 
becomes particularly evident in the religion of Ihdia 
but ife equally obvious in the development of Christian 
conceptions, even though in this case this power and 
influence is limited by the historical

legend which surrounds the beginnings of these con¬ 
cepts, With the progressive exaltation of the cult 
objects, beginning7the agri-cults (Ackerkulte) the 
gradual transformation of the gods out of super¬ 
human nature demons into spiritual beings (geistige 
Maechte) takes place, «^^nd as a result of the mut- 
ually-modifyij^ interaction of cult and gods the 
motives and objectives of the former tend likewise 
to become super-sensuous and spiritual*" 1 

To-day the anthropomorphic element in the god- 
idea has receded very much. In a world which has been 
very much explored by man both in its inner and in its 
outer aspects, both with regard to its setting in space 
as well as to its setting in time, man finds it increas¬ 
ingly difficult to find a place for an anthropomorphic 
god* Then the tendency is to regard god rather as an 
ideal* God is the synthesis of ideal values* It is 
the cult which, according to Wundt has enhanced greatly 
this process of idealization of the god-concept. 

"In the soul-life of the individual, actions , 
together with the feelings and emotions fundamental 
to it, have the primacy over ideation. The same 
psychological fact universally accounts for the 
superior importance of deity cult over deity myth* 

It is action that constantly influences ideas, 
changing and strengthening them, and thus arousing 
new emotions which stimulate to further activities. 
Thus, the elevation of the gods into ideal beings 
must be ascribed, in great part, to religious cult, 
for it came about as the result of the influence 
which the emotion associated with the cult exercised 
upon the ideas of gods. - 

Cult is to be regarded as moulding: rather than 
as permanently expressing religious emotions; and it 
is not merely an effect but also a source of reli¬ 
gious ideas. It is in cult that deity ideas first 
attain their full significance." 2

Man learns by doing. The doing of a thing results in 
a satisfied feeling. This feeling of satisfaction tends 
to give rise to ideas about the action. The rationalization 
of his behaviour forms a prolific source of man*s idealogy# 
That applies also to his religious ideas. 

’'By giving expression to his desires in prayer 
and sacrifice, man enjoys a foretaste of their satis¬ 
faction, and this, in reaction, enhances not only the 
desires but also the mythological conceptions funda¬ 
mental to them. It is precisely this relationship of 
myth to cult that extends far back into the totemic age 
and that, causes the dominant magic cults of this per¬ 
iod to be displaced by deity cults as soon as gods 
have a^risen through a synthesis of heroes and demonsT 


While stressing the importance of the cult practices 
in the formation of religious ideas, we must not overlook 

i 

I the vital part that the emotions have played both in the 

i 

! 

I development of the cult and in the creation of ideas. This 

! 

I all the more so since the emotions over against the intel- 

I 

! 

lect as creative and modifying forces is characteristic of 

i 

j Wundt ’s psychology. It is held by many that the question: 
Why? has led man to form ideas about god, and that the 
gods therefore owe their existence primarily to man’s cur- 
i iosity. Wundt, like Bergson, discounts the power of the 

i 

I intellect and refuses it a role in the sphere of creation. 

I ’*Nicht die neugierige Frage nach dem Warum der 

! Erscheinungen hat, wie die landlaeufige Mythentheorie 

! und die intellektualistische Vulgaerpsychologie an- 

i zunehmen pflegen die Goetter geschaffen, sondern 

! durch die Affekte der Hoffnung and Furcht, die die

der unentbehrlichen Subsistenzmittel des Lebens 
begleiten, sind die Gestalten des Daemonenglaubens 
und des Mythenmaerchens mit beginnender Kultur zu 
segnenden oder drohenden Himmelsgoettern erhoben 
worden, denen der gemeinsame Kult sich zuwandte. So 
hat der Kultus die Goetter geschaffen und nich um¬ 
gekehrt*” 1 

(Not the curious question as to the Why? of phe¬ 
nomena, as the current theories of mythology and the 
intellectualizing 'Vulgar Psychology* usually assume, 
created ttie gods. It was the emotions of fear and 
hope which accompany the common concern about growth 
and possible destruction of indispensible means of 
subsistence in the midst of which the beings of 
demon-faith and *Mythenmaerchen*, with the be¬ 
ginnings of culture, were elevated into biessing 
and destroying heaven-gods toward whom the cult 
was directed. Thus the cult created the gods and 
not vice versa.) 

Certainly the intellect has been a factor in the 
development of the god-concept. Where, otherwise, would 
philosophy come in as a contributing factor in the formation 
of concepts? The influence of the rationalizing tendency 
of the Greek mind on the modification of the god-idea is 
one of the principle subjects of Martin Nilsson’s History 
of the Greek Religion. Wundt, however, protests against 
the tendency to grant the intellect a pre-eminent role in 
the generation and modification of the god-idea. His in¬ 
sistence on the importance of the emotion, as generated 
in, and as generating, the cult, is characteristic. 

’♦Sven less than t^re mythological thought from 
which it develops does religious reflection consist 
simply of ideas. The mythical tales and legends into 
which ideas are woven excite primarily the feelings 
and emotions. These it is that cause the exaltation 
of the religious consciousness, giving rise to action 
which, in turn, enhances the emotions. If anywhere, 
therefore, it is in the psychology of religion that

inteIle ctualism is doomed to failure* The intellec- 
tualist is unable even to explain the fact of cult, 
to say nothing of those effects upon religion by 
virtues of which cult becomes religion’s creative 
force* 1 

Many and important elements in the god-idea owe their 
origin and development to the cult* In the following we 
shall call attention to several instances* 

’’Give us this day our daily bread.” It is a prayer 
spoken by millions even today. God as the benign power 
v/hich bestows upon man, or at least helps man to acquire, 
i the necessities of life is an idea that has a long history* 

' It owes its origin and develoijment chiefly to the ”culture 

! «.< -e 

i agri”* Cults designed/to bring the aid of the gods to 
i bear upon the production of food existed at a pre-religious 

j 

I period in the form of vegetation cults. These cults mirror 
I and also modify the demon-and-god-idea at all levels of 
; culture* At the pre-agriculture level such cults consis- 
i ted of magical rites intended to induce the fertility de- 

j mons to come to the aid of nature* 

I 

I With the increase of poiDulation man found it nec- 

i 

I 

I essary to till the soil in order to provide himself with 
I food. The vegetation demons called on to render assis- 

j tance in the production of necessities of life. The purpo^ 

! 

! of pouring water on the harvest girl originally, at least, 

i 

was to spur to activity the demon in the rain cloud* The 
I magic method of dealing with god is still obvious in such 

a rite. To leave a sheaf of the harvest on the field, a

survival of which is recorded in the Hook of Ruth, was a 
practice originally intended to insure a crop for the 
coming year. It is an instance of '‘syrnQ^ilisher Zauber". 

The phallic dance with energetic activity and creative 
pantomimic was intended to induce the demon of fertility 
to increased fertility. With the development of agricul¬ 
ture and a non-nomadic, fixed-abode, living habits, the 
growth of community interests, such original demon-cults 
developed into cults of gods and with this development 

t 

went the development of demons into gods. 

^As long as they (the agriculuture-affecting 
powers) continue to have their seat in the fertile 
soil or in the growing harvest itself, they belong 
to the realm of nature demons. As the culture of 
the soil takes up more of the effort and toil of 
the producer, the powers which control rain and 
sunshine and which therefore enter into the labours 
of man as helpers or as hindrances, such powers 
tend to become objects of hope and fear. There¬ 
with those beings which at one time were regarded 
at the primitive level as little more than playful 
creations of the fancy, come to have a real 
significance and powers of vital consequence for 
both the present and the future, — Good crops 
and poor crops came of the gods.—More and more 
%he cult activities are henceforth directed 
toward the ideal beings of the heaven-gods. Under 
the unifying influence of the great vegetation 
festivals the god-cults cairre to/assimilated 
/and integrated with soul-.- and ancestor-cults and 
thus the cult served to unify soul- ancestor- and 
nature-god concepts.” 

”In solcher Weise bilden the Vegetationskulte die 
wichtigsten Ausgangspunkte fuer die Goetterkulte.” 1 

Thus it is seen, incidentally, that the religious 

interest and the worship of the gods of agriculture who 

help and who hinder the supply of daily bread have had a

generating influence on the development of the church year, 

the great religious festivals and even our civic calendar. 

’^The great cult festivals become lihked with the 
annual course of the sun. Fixed solstices take the 
place of unstable seed-time and harvest-time.^^ 

survival of this food-providing element in 
the god-concept is mirrored in a portion of the standard 
church prayer of liturgical churches today in which God 
is appealed to ’*to cause the needful fruits of the earth 
to prosper, that we may enjoy them in due season.’* 1 
In times of drought such prayers tend to become 
really earnest* 

The idea that God is the bestower of eternal 

life can also be traced back to cults relating to the 

culture of the soil. To-day, fundamentalism is still 

chiefly concerned with the attainment of life eternal 

and immortality is still very decidedly a gift of the gods. 

’^he cults of Demeter practiced in Sleusis had as 
their aim, not only an increased productiveness of 
the soil, but also success in the interests and 
activities of the world. Since they related to hap¬ 
piness in general, it was but natural that, as soon 
as the ideas of a beyond reached a point of develop¬ 
ment at which the yonder-world became a focus of 
desires and hopes, the cults also should necessarily 
concern themselves with the happiness in a life after 
death. Thus, interest in the beyond came to be one 
of the further cult motives that linked themselves to 
the dominant vegetation cults. —When agriculture 
was in its beginnings, the most pressing needs of life 
was that of daily bread. For the tiller of the soil, 
moreover, the change of seasons marked by seed-time and 
harvest, represent sharply defined periods, suitable 
above all others for the festivals to which tribal 
associates assemble from near and far.

As the result of the reaction of cult activities 
upon the emotions, concern for the future happiness 
of the soul finally came more and more to over¬ 
shadow the desires connected with this world. 

Thus, the cults of Demeter eventually passed over, 
in all essentials, into cults of the b«yond. 

The same is true of the Dionysos cults of the 
Greeks, of the Egyptian worship of Isis and 
Osiris, of the Persian Mithra cult, and of many 
other mystery cults of Oriental origin. All of 
these express the same passion for a future bliss 
that shall begin at the close of earthly life 
and endure endlessly.^' 1 

From the conception that god is the giver of 
a blissful, carefree, undisturbed, secure eternal life 
after death, it is no far cry to the idea that god is 
also the giver of those spiritual blessings here and now 
which are most akin, qualitatively, with the blessings 
of eternal lifer rest, peace, joy, in finer aequam 
animam in arduis rebus. And it is particularly in the 
ecstatic phases of many cults that this conception of 
god as the giver of a blissful life here and now found 
its development* 

”Even in the vegetation festivals of the semi- 
cultural peoples of America, with their elements 
of totemism and ancestor worship, an important 
place is occupied by the ecstatic features - by 
the orgiastic dance, and by the ecstasy which 
results from sexual excitement and from narcotic 
poisons, such as tobacco. Conjurations, prayer, 
sacrifice and other cult ceremonies aid in stirrirg 
the emotions. Doubtless it was due to these 
ecstatic elements that the cult of Dionysos gained 
supremacy over the older cults of Demeter in the 
Greek mysteries, and the Dionysos himself was 
eventually given a place in the Demeter cult. 

For is he not the god of wine, the most potent 
of all the means for creating a oomdition of bliss 


1. Elements, f. 423. 








- 134 - 


that elevates above all earthly cares? In the 
mystery cults, however, the central feature of the 
cult activity was the vision experienced in the 
e.cstasy* The mysterious equipment of the place, 
the preliminary ascetic practices, the liturgic 
conjurations and sacrifices, the wine, which 
originally toolf the place of the blood sacrifice, 
and, among the Hindoos, the soma, which was itself 
deified - all of these served to transport cons« 
ciousness to another world, so that the cult became 
increasingly concerned with the world beyond ', 
and the god worshipped in such cults became increas« 
ingly the giver of such desired spiritual blessings, 
to be enjoyed here and hereafterT 1 

A personal god who dwells within the hearts 
of the devotee is a comparatively late (development and 
denotes an advanced stage in the process of spiritualiza¬ 
tion of the god-idea. Äs an impersonal power that could 
be shared in by physical contact with an object or person 
that had *mana' the conception of an indwelling-power 
began already at the time when man had not progressed 
beyoni the mana-concept of a deity. However, the develop¬ 
ment of this idea to the point at which the worshipper 
felt himself*possessedS or^god-intoxicated» must be 
I traced in the development and influence of ecstatic 
cults. 

«Even tlie demon cults frequently exhibit one 
feature, particularly, that remains characteristic 
of religions in the cult the individual feels 
himself one with the object of worship. This is 
clearly shown in the case of primitive vegetation 
cults, and festivals. I'hose who execute the 
orgiastic cult dances regard themselves as one 
with the spirits of vegetation," whom they wish to 
assist by their actions, in increasing the pro¬ 
ductive forces bf nature.« @

Thus the way was paved for the birth of the notion of 
a Christ who dwells within the heart of a believer and 
also the idea of believers being 

^the temple of the Holy ^host,^ "Know ye not that 
ye are the ttemple of God and that the bjirit of 

God dwelleth in you?" 1 

The conception of god as the giver of spiritual 
blessings brings us to the discussion of another element 
in the god- concept which is closely related to it. 

It is an element in the god-idea which continues to 
occupy a prominent place to the present day. -^nd 
certain features of the idea will possibly continue to 
snjoy an increasing place of prominence in the conscious¬ 
ness of man, since the present and future well-being, not 
to say existence, of manappears to be vitally related 
to this aspect of the god-idea. I refer to the idea of 
a god of love; I mean the conception of god as a god of 
laercy, of grace, of benevolence; a god of peace and good 
will. At a time when individuals and small groups could 
live in comparative isolation and freedom from conflict 
with other individuals or groups, the need for a forgiving 
attitude of mind and a god in whom this attitude was 
mirrored in an idealized form, was not keenly felt. 

Men could go out of each others way and thus avoid con¬ 
flict. With the gradual elimination of individual and 


1. 1 Cor. 3, 16. 




■/S- 


:<.C:

i. J 







136 - 


and group isolation, there arose the need of a forgiving 
attitude of mind. The necessity of having to live to¬ 
gether brought these spiritual values to the foreground. 
At a time when the interdependence of individuals and 
groups is bedoming increasingly obvious, the divine 
quality of a forgiven, a forgiving spirit and one which 
is foi;4iving, is likewise tending to become increasingly 
important. The phrase *for giving* tefers to the need 
of co-operation, as the need of these *Heilsgueter' 
becomes more urgent, it is but psychologically natural 
for man to project these upon the beings, and more 
particularly, upon that Being, which man visualizes 
as governing in a projected, idealized world, whether

I I refer to sacrifice» 

The sacrifice in its earliest forms was not directed 
to a god at all. It mirrors a belief in souls and demons. 
Thus the sacrifice was intended at first to keep away 
the spirits of the dead. Then it came to be a gift to 
the dead in order to supply the soul of the dead with 
the necessities of life in a supposed other world. In 
a demon-worshipping age the sacrifice served to ward

off the angry demon. As a supplement to the incantations 
and ’Zauberworte^ it served as a magical means of ren¬ 
dering the devotee secure against the possible attacks 
of sickness demons. Only at a later stage did the 
sacrifice come to be an attempt to win the favour and 
the help of unseen powers. When the sacrifice takes on 
this nature it presages the appearance of the gods. 

In a god-worshipping age the sacrifice represents an 
attempt to win the Jfavour of the gods for the dead and 

1 

for the living. The peace offering and thank offering 
mirror both a higher ethics and a higher conception of 
god. In its final stage the offering represents an 
outward manifestation of an inner attitude of self- 
denial and self-sacrifice in the interest of an ideal. 

1 

The nature of the sacrifice varies all the 
way from intoxicating juices, tobacco, parts of the 
totem animal in an age of totemism; soul-carrying parts 
of the human body, blood, fat, hair; the first fruits 
j of the flock and field in a shepherding and in a sub- 
I sequent agricultural age; anything of sentimental vaäLue; 

I 

human beingsj deified human beingsf the deity itself, 
and in its final stage the self-interest and self-will. 

Ä sacrifice for sin mirrors a social environ¬ 
ment which disapproves of certain kinds of anti-social 
conduct. Subsequently it mirrors but it also helps to

make possible a conception of a god who is righteous, 
indignant, wrathful. It is thus in the midst of the 
sacrificial cult that there develops the notion of a 
god who needs to be atoned, reconciled. This again 
necessitates that a sin-offering be made and a ransom 
paid. It is thus that a redeemer-god, a saviour from 
sin who sacrifices himself for the sins of the people, 
appears on the seene. Certainly the conception of 
such a god had a generating and modifying influence on 
the sacrifical cult practices. It woulJ be idle to 
deny this. Nor does Wundt deny this. He does contend, 
however, that *the cults have created the gods, and that 

j 

the sacrificial cult, for example, has contributed in 
jno small measure to the evolution of a god who needs

ment as being the most important in individual and 
group well-being were regarded as the most appropri¬ 
ate to propitiate and win the favour of the powers that 
shape our ends* At first a-soul-carrying part of the 
human body, then a totem animal or a pait of it, subse¬ 
quently a leading member of the group, a king possibly, 
the first fruit of the flock, the fields, or the womb; 
a lamb without blemish; until it reached its climax in 
an idealized and deified human being: *the lamb of 
God which taketh away the sin of the world^. In this 
connection we have occasion also to observe the emer¬ 
gence of the idea of substitution* At first the lamb, 
or scape-goat, later a selected member of the community 
and still later the idea of god substituting himself 
for man was thus evolved, in and through the sacrificial 
cult* 


^The Abraham and Isaac story — the Roman Satur¬ 
nalia, the Pe^?sian festival of Saacea, and other 
agricultural cults of the ancient world, exhibit 
traces of the sacrifices of a human being who 
represent the deity himself* Along with these 
we might probably also mention the Babylonian 
festival of Tammus and the Jewish feast of Purim* 
Finally, the Christian conception of the sacrificial 
death of Jesus combine the same ideas, though 
their religious significance is transformed and 
reinforced by the thought of redemption, which 
has displaced the older protective and fortune¬ 
bringing magic. The sacrificial community has 
here become the whole of mankind, and the one who 
by his death brings about a reconciliation with

the deity is himself the god. For this reason 
dogma insists - with a logic that is perhaps 
unconscious and mystical in nature, yet all the 
more compelling- on the unity of the divine person¬ 
ality with that of the redeemer who dies the 
sacrificial death. The fusion of sacrificial 
conceptions thus gave rise to the most effective 
story that the human mind ever conceived.*’ 1 

The emphasis on the fact that the cult practices 

have been a generating and modifying factor in relation 

to the development of the concept would become one-sided 

were we to ignore the contribution that other factors 

have made toward the formation of the god-idea. The 

self-sacrificing 

development of the conception of god as the god of/love, 

of mercy, is an example. The prophets, their personal 

experience and national vision, and their contribution 

to the development of this aspect of the god-idea is a 

matter of historical record. When Hosea declared: 

”Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet 
an adulteress, according to the love of the Lord 
toward the children of Israel, who look to other 
gods and love flagons of wine. So I bought her for 
me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer 
of barley, and an half homer of barley: and I 2 
said unto her: Thou shalt abide for me many days”, 

he made an important contribution toward the development 

of the conception of god as a redeemer who purchased 

his people with his own blood. 

Nor would we be giving an objective history 

of the development of the conception of god as the 

embodiment of self-sacrificing love if we failed to make

mentioD of the contribution toward the development of 

this idea made by the prophet Isaiah who declared: 

”Surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our 
sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten 
of God and afflicted. He was wounded for our 
transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: 
the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with 
his stripes we are healed. — The Lord hath laid 
on him the iniquity of us all.'^ 1 

The unethical idea that a god is a being v;hich 

can be bribed is also attributable to the influence of 

the sacrifice in the form of a gift. At a stage of 

economic development in which trading and bargaining 

I 

featured commercisil enterprise the emergence of such a 
propensity projected into god would not be altogether 

I 

unnatural. Wundt, in contrast to others, holds this 
notion of god to be of late origin. It is, incidentally, 
against this element in the Christian (?) conception of 
God as received from the Old Testament, which is, of 

! 

I course, of Jewish origin, that the present religious 

I movement in Germany under the Hitler regime claims to 

2 

be directed. It is claimed to be in an attempt to 
eradicate this element in the god-concept which prompts 
them to either eliminate the O.T. altogether or at least 
to subject it as well as the New Testament to a thorough¬ 
going purge. It is.held that the notion of God as being 
one who is willing to accept a bribe obviously mirrors 

If Isaiah, 53, 4.5.

~ 142 


a typically Hebrew attitude of mind, is too utilitariaji 
a conception of God and religion and is unworthy of a 
people which appreciates duty and loyalty, values higher 
than utility. 

In an age when personal, family and tribal 
security hinged largely on alliances and covenants with 
powerful associates and covenant-making was a common 
social practice, the idea of a covenant-god appeared* 
Covenant-making as well as expiation for covenant breaking 
played an important part also in the cult practices of 
peoples* Thus the dacrificial cult made its contribution 
I also to the development of the idea that god is an ideal 
covenanter who is absolutely faithful, trustworthy, 
who will not break his promise and u^der no condition 
! break his covenant pledge and who saith: 

I 

I ^^For the mountains shall depart and hills be re- 

j moved; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, 

I neither shall the covenant of my peaee be removed, 

saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee*** 1 

The development of the concejition of God as 
the Sanctifier has undoubtedly also been greatly en¬ 
hanced by cult practices, more particularly by the 
purificatory rites and ceremonies. In a social atmos¬ 
phere saturated with taboo-ideas, purificatory rites, 
whether by water, by blood, or by fire, came to be cult 
practices of great importance. At first intended to 
cleanse from offenses against taboo regulations, such 


1. Isaiah 54, 10* 











143 - 


rites came to be regarded as means for rendering the 

individual clean and fit for the company of gods and 

god's people* This 'Unfwertung' of such rites denote that 

taboo ideas have become integrated with the god-ccnicept* 

*'Taboo-ideas lead to cult practices as their ade¬ 
quate expression, as soon as the itaboo becomes 
associated with tne god-idea. For it requires 
special activities which, while they serve to ward 
off dangers threatening because of infringement 
of the taboo, at the same time serve to win the 
protection of tne gods* — Thus the affections of 
fear and hope are found united in the cult'*. 1 

Where purificatory sacraments, such as baptism, 
is still regarded as being effective ex opere operate 
the taboo and demon elements in the god-concept are 
obviously still predominant. Where such rites tend to 
take on the nature of morally-purifying agencies a 
conception of god as an ethical synthesis is obviously 
in the ascendency. Quite obviously, ablution, lustration 
and other purificatory ..-rites have enhanced the develop¬ 
ment of the idea that God is a power which cleanses, 
purifies, sanctifies, both outwardly and inwardly. 

The notion of god as a sanctifying power through 
communion with and through »dwelling in» the individual 
was greatly enhanced by the sacrificial meal. Partici¬ 
pation in the sacrificial feast means sharing in the 
cleansing and sanctifying influence of the deity sacri¬ 
ficed. 

1. Voelkerpsychologie, 6, 3, p. 464. 






144 


•‘The highest form of sanctification originates in 
sacrifice itself. It appears as soon as the idea 
of intercourse with the deity becomes elevated to 
that of communion with him. This occurs «specially 
in the sacrificial feast. When the sacrificial 
food is sanctified by virtue of the fact that the 
deity partakes of it, this sanctification is im¬ 
parted to those human individuals who share of the 
sacrifice. In j)roportion as the worth of the 
sacrifice increases, so does also the degree of 
sanctification. The latter reaches its culmination 
in human sacrifice, where the person sacrificed is 
the representative both of the sacrificial community 
and of the deity itself. Sanctification here be¬ 
comes deification for every partidipant in the 
sacrifice. Following the disappearance of human 
sacrifice, this idea was maintained in connection 
with the sacred animal that tes substituted for 
man, and finally, after bloody sacrifice was 
entirely abandoned, in connection with the bread 
which constituted the sacrificial food.” 1 

The practice of the Roman Catholic Church as 
well as that of the High Anglican Church to adore the 
host and regard it as worthy of adoration ordinarily 
shown toward the deity only shows the powerful influence 
of cult practices upon conceptions of the deity. The 
three conceptions of the consecrated bread and wine in 
Holy Communion, as found in the R.C., Lutheran, and the 
Reformed Churches mirror a progressively spiritualized 
conception of God. An increasing inwardness of the 
religious consciousness and a corresponding increasing 
spiritual coneeption of God is thus both mirrored and 
made in the development of this phase of the sacrificial 
cult. 


1. Elements -f. 447

Holiness is an essential characteristic of the 

gOQS. Holy and godly are synonym'^us terms* Gods alone 

can make men holy. The presence of a holy god tends to 

render cult, , objects and Jjlaces, such as the altar, 

temple, articles used in rites of purification and 

sanctification, holy. Holiness is a ‘being separated 

from ordinary use.* That which is holy must not be 

tasted, tcuched or handled. Unclean persons must not 

come nigh to anything holy. 

"Holiness distinguishes a god from so-called 
‘Heilbringer* of nature peoples, such as the 
crow of the ‘^‘inklit, the great rabbit of the 
Algonquin Indians, who by their great power 
bring man into possession of cultural values, 
which however, are not in the least holy." 1 

Obviously the holiness of the gods is an import- 
ajit element in the inheritance which the gods received 
from an age which was dominated by conceptions of taboo. 
^Taboo* implies that a person or object, or place, must 
not be touched. No one but those specially prepared for 
it,dare come near. 

"Die Vorstellungen und Affekte die diesem Gebiet 
(*Tabu*) angehoeren greifen in die gesamte Ent¬ 
wickelung des mythologischen und religioesen 
Denkens von den primitiven Zauberkulten an bis 
zu den Religionen der Kulturvoelker als wichtige 
Factoren ein." 2 

Only the concept of ‘interaction* will help us 
to picture with reasonable adequacy the mutually-modify¬ 
ing influence of holiness-ideas as postulated of the 

1. Vlkpsych. 6,3, p. 310. 2. Ibid., p. 309. 








146 


deity and purificatory cult practices as found at practi¬ 
cally all levels of human culture* Undoubtedly purific- 
atory rites have contributed in no small measure in 
creating and preserving a conception of god which causes 
worshippers to stand in awe and reverence at proper 
distance from the place where the deity is believed to 
be present and to express their emotions in the words: 

"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts; the whole 
earth is full of his glory." 1 

If the cult practices have factored in the 

creation and preservation of the holiness of gods, they 

have played no less a creative and preserving role in 

the evolution of the * wisdom* of the gods. There can 

be no gain-saying the claim that the gods are largely 

*Wunschwesen*. Gods as *wish-beings* are projections 

of human hopes and aspirations. As long as a devotee 

seriously expects his wishes to be granted and seriously 

believes that they are granted by the deity to which he 

appeals for help in the attainment of his wishes, he 

will quite self-evidently credit such a being with true 

wisdom in granting sugh a fulfillment of wishes. 

**That the deity will grant the wishes V7hich man 
through prayer and sacrifice brings to the at- 
tion of the deity, and that the gods in keeping 
with the nature of those wishes make resolutions 


1* Is. 6,3 





-- 147 


and, under certain circumstances, repent of them 
again, that is a foregone conclusion of the cult* 

— If in the presence of this onslaught of human 
wishes on the deity the idea of an absolute god is 
to prevail — nothing remains but that his ideas 
become transcendental and that the limitations of 
the answers to his prayers become projected into 
the deity itself. In the practice of the religious 
life this subjectivization of the god-idea, which 
remains as a remant of anthropomorphic god-ideas, 
expresses itself in this that all reality and exis¬ 
tence is regardedVof a divine will guided by an 
unfathomable divine wisdom^ and that man, whose 
own destiny is inseparably connected with this 
divine will, must, simply submit.” 1 


l‘he tendency to regard the deity as the 
Absolute and AH-vvise in the presence of which power 
man had best resign himself to his fate and take 
whatever comes in good grace, leave all to the ruler- 
ship and determination of such an All-wise One, and 
practice the gentle art of resignation, is in Wundt*s 
opinion in the ascendency, at least in wide sections of 
humanity and wherever cult practices are observed and 
taken seriously. 

*hJndoubtedly this conception (of an All-wise 
Absolute Being) is on the ascendency in the 
present religious cult of the Christian world, even 
though ^th^- thought of a magical influencing of the 
deity is still widely prevalent.” 2 

Something remains to be said about the origin 

and development of the conception of god as one and 

the relation of this development to the cult. Cult 

practices and, particularly, deity cult festivals were 

occasions wn which the community gathered. ?he socially-

unifying influence of the cult is obvious. While forming 
a link and a bond of unity among the members of one 
tribe, or city, or state at a much later date, the deity 
cult undoubtedly helped to pave the way for a conception 
of god wide enough to include all men, yea, the entire 
universe. We dare not minimize the abstractions of 
philosophy and science in the formation of a monotheistic 
concept of God. Nor would we overlook the contribution 
made by the leaders of Hebrew thought toward the develop¬ 
ment of monotheism. However, the part that cults 
related to the soil and soil productivity have played 
and the role which gods who controlled the clouds and 
the sky as developed in such cults is a factor in 
the development of a monotheistic conception of god 
which Wundt would not have us to underestimate. 

"Not in a supreme god, carried over from the 
notion of an earthly supreme ruler into the heavenly 
realm, nor less even in an pre-historic ghost- 
faith of doubtful origin, nor in a tribal god in 
whose original character the spiritual essence 
of the odeity is by no means pre-eminent, but in 
the idea of one divine world ruler and in the one¬ 
ness of spiritual attributes closely associated 
with such a supreme ruler, we may look for the 
germ of that idea of a one single deity an idea 
which, in its developed form belongs neither to 
primitive consciousness nor to the consciousness 
of early historic times." 1 

True, the tendency to a monotheistic conception 
of god mirrors a social ofder and is indicative of a

cultural level* Wundt however would have us regard 
monotheism more as a mere symptom rather than as a 
generating factor. 

'^Monotheism is by some outrightly regarded as the 
birth of higher religion. Though this idea is 
commonly held, it will not bear closer critical 
scrutiny. When the facts are looked at objectively, 
there can remain no doubt that the conception of 
one ruling god emerges at an early date and that 
from thence onward it never entirely disappears. 

For it constitutes undoubtedly an immediate 
'heavenly reflex* of the origin of the god-cult 
which a&companies an earthly social order. The 
god-community demands such an one. In this sense 
the conception of one ruling god is for the first 
a symptom of social culture which exercises an 
influence also on the religious conception. 

Directly, however, it has nothing to do with the 
latter." 1 

In many instances a one-supreme god was original¬ 
ly but a 'primus inter pares*. With the fusion of cults, 
one survived as the highest god. In other instances the 

gradual acceptance of one supreme god is the result of 
2) a 

cult wars. This is typified in the religion of the 

Israelites. There is no real reason, however, for 

lolding that the religion of the Israelites was not 

originally also polytheistic. 

"The angels and their opponents, satan and his 
demons, do form an integral part of the religion 
of Jahwe, much as the Greek pantheon centred about 
the figure of Zeus. Here as there the supreme 
god demands an environment and the various worries 
and wishes of man demand a variety of helpful 
spirits,- even though their power be limited." 2

An instance of what is known as cultural 
accomodation and at the same time an attempt to ration¬ 
alize a fusion of polytheistic and monotheistic concep¬ 
tions of god is found in what '/»/undt calls the 'tritheism* 
of Christian theology. 

"A vivid example for this (the accomodation and 
fusion of polytheistic cults) is found in 
Christianity. As a folk religion it is tri-theism. 
For no one who is not a stranger to the folk- soul, 
would pretend to make himself believe that the 
dogma of the trinity had ever got beyond the sphere 
of speculative theology and a limited sphere of 
lay people. In the Christian cult Christ is the 
ruling god, behind whom, elevated above the direct 
approach of the faithful, stands God the Father, 
while the Holy Ghost has remained a demon-like 
being, never quite successfully having reached 
the personality-stage of development, for which 
failure he at times must give way to other holy 
persons, such as the virgin Mary. In the Catholic 
cult an abundance of under-gods, apostles, saints, 
occupying as they do the position once held by 
locality-, profession- and other helper-gods, have 
found their way into membership of the holy 
family.” 1 

The ‘ungeheure -^npassungsfaehigkeit* of the 
Catholic Church is a matter of admiration on the part 
of Wundt. 


It is noteworthy that the very first injunction 
of the Decalogue posits many gods. "Thou shalt have no 
other gods before me”, suggests, of course, the existence 
of other gqds. -^nd it was only after the culture of 
flocks and herds had been superceded by agriculture, 
and Jahwe likewise had undergone appropriate transformation

The de'Viö-opment of the ' cultura agri^ thus had

Chapter Seven ; Ethics and Metaphysics in Their Relation 

to the Development of the God-Concept. 

”Die Goetter bessern sicl:jfciit ihren Gemeinden’^ 
Thus Hoeffding begins one of his chapters in ‘The 
Philosophy of Religion** The implication is that a 
higher ethical conception of God is the result of a 
more refined moral tone and improved moral conduct among 
the worshippers• Opinion is, however, not altogether 
unanimous in this matter. The relationship between 
morality and religion is a favorite and debatable 
question not only for undergraduate essayists but for 
those also who have reached a degree of maturity in 
philosophic discussions. The popular notion, of course, 
is that growth in ethical consciousness is the result 
of faith in a more ethical conception of God. That 
there is some vital relationship between a decalogue¬ 
giving Jahwe on Sinai with a righteous-minded people 
of Israel is obvious. Whether there is a causal relation¬ 
ship and, if so, which is cause and which is effect, 
is less obvious. In an age in which ancient incentives 
to duty-doing appear to be losing their efficacy and 
where lawlessness as a contemperaneous phenomenon has 
tended to become the most urgent and, incidentally, 
also the most expensive affair of an advanced nation of 
the most progressive civilization of the world, the 









- 153 - 

question raised here becomes acute. In the interest of 
individual survival and social cohesion, leaders will 
need to turn in one of two possible directions. Must 
they and will they return to a faith in the God of the 
fathers or may God and religion be passed by as irrevelant 
to the issue and is it possible for man to solve his 
own social problems in his own way? Or does the solution 
lie in the retention of a God-idea which is more refined 
and not inconsistent with known facts about the universe? 

Some light by way of guidance for intel¬ 
ligent action will be shed on the problem by inquiring 

i 

into the genetic relationship between ethics and the 
god-idea.. 

*^It is in the deity-cult (and therefore the deity 
itself) where for the first time motives become 
effective which have a bearing on the moral yearn¬ 
ings (sittliche Regungen) which lie hidden in 
mores and customs. The fear of God is essentially 
different from the fear of a demon. As gods 
gradually withdraw from the sphere of magical 
influence, they help the mortals in distress and 
visit them, with punishment according as they them¬ 
selves see fit to do so. (^nach eigenem Ermessen*) 
And thus evolves gradually the conception of a 
highest tribunal of justice presided over by a 
highest god. Even though the rulership of this 
god may continue to be arbitrary in many respects 
yet finally the idea stands out that God v;ants 
the good and will punish the bad. Of course, 
the norm according to which such judgment is made 
originated in the subjective feelings of individuals. 
(Die Norm die hierueber entscheidet ist zunaechst 
aus dem subjectiyen Gefuehl des Einzelnen auf die 
Gottheit hinueber gewandert) And not until this 













154 


transference has taken place does it come to be a 
real norm. For not until then has it the power to 
bind the conscience of the individual in the newly- 
awakened feeling of the individual that the command 
of a superior all-commanding Will must be obeyed* 

The realization of this fact reacts in a clarify¬ 
ing way upon the moral sentiment. The instinctive 
feelings of ad-version and aversion then come to 
be commands to love the neighbor, reverence the 
aged, t .0 consecrate and dedicate oneself to a 
community closely knitted together by cult and 
custom. Whoever frivolously disregards a custom 
which by now has become a religious law is visited 
with all those forms of punishment with which 
men were punished by demons in an age prior to 
that in which good and bad were distinguished. 

At the same time the deity lays limitations upon 
vicious vengeance and the blind urge to murder 
by throwing its protective sanctions about the 
guest-right (Gastrecht) and by protecting even the 
murderer who takes refuge in its sanctuary. 

Thus moral norms emerge through the mediation 
of the deity-cults out of the primitive conflict 
between egoistic and altruistic urges. The source 
of these norms lie hidden deep within the individual 
consciousness Q.^ and are projected upon the will 
of the gods". 2 

Hence the problem of priority once again 
dissolves in the midst of the concept of interaction, 

Wundt does insist that moral norms have originated in 
man and not in objectively-pre-existent gods. Moral 
codes mirror man*^s moral sentiments. Man is his own 
law-maker. By implication it would appear obvious that 
man may abrogate the laws which he himself has made, 
provided, of course, he has made quite sure that laws 
which may have played a vital part in his individual 
and social evolution can now be dispensed with. 

1. 9emuet 

2. Voelkerpsychologie 6,3, p. 534, 







- 165 


Wundt nevertheless concedes a creative role to the gods 
in as much as laws and the ethical principles created 
by man did not really begin to function effectively 
until they enjoyed the sanction of the gods. From this 
we conclude that man must be very cautious in dissociating 
norms which he still considers vital to individual, 
national and inter-national well-being from religion and 
a belief in God. Unless he can find an effective sub¬ 
stitute for God to endow cherished norms with sanctity 
among the average people, he had better not injudiciously 
disregard God and religion as irrevelant. 

Here, too, we have occasion to observe the 

< 

i 

modifying influence of ethics on the god-idda. Under 
the re-creative influence of more refined moral senti¬ 
ments the gods, at first arbitrary and demon-like, tend 
to evolve into moral ideals. 

‘’Here the ethical norms react upon the conception 
of gods., the gods whose rulership was at first but 
little distinguished from the coarse arbitrariness 
of a hero-worshipping age, to which they owe their 
origin, come to resemble more and more moral ideals 
as moral strivings which have originated in a 
higher culture are projected upon them.'^ 1 

Thus the evolution of the deity from a • 
personal anthropomorphic being into a super-sensuous 
ideal takes place under the god-regenerating influence

of more refined human ethical sentiments. 

“Even though the anthropomophization of the moral 
sentiments may hinder the process, finally the 
stage of development is nevertheless attained in 
which the deity is transformed into an otherworldly 
and super-sensuous ideal. Religion (and the god- 
idea) thus assist in the development of moral 
sentiments and the moral concepts help in the 
transformation of the god-idea into religious 
ideals. Thus culminates the mutually-modifying 

interaction of religion and morality. - So 

kann man das paradox scheinende Wort aussprechen: 
Die Sittlichkeit ist ein Erzeugniss der Religion, 
aber nicht minder ist die Religion ein Erzeugniss 
der Sittlichkeit.“ 1 

To think that man has outgrown the stage where 
ji he needs more than a mere abstract ethical ideal is 
to have misunderstood human nature. At best, it is to 
ignore strata of intellectual and cultural differences. 
The average man, at least, needs an ^external symbol of 
his ethical ideal, better still an incarnation of that 
ideal. This persistent need was supplied in the develop¬ 
ment of the god-idea as an ideal human being: Jesus. 

“Only one more step is lacking to bring this pro¬ 
cess (of interaction between ®thics and the god- 
idea) to a conclusion'. The religious ideal, which 
originated in the projection of the ethical senti¬ 
ments into a super-sensuous world must again react 
upon the moral world because it (the moral world) 
is an integral part of the world of human striving 
and aspirations in order to become, within this 
mundane sphere, an absolute moral ideal. This 
process reaches its most significant culmination 
in Christendom where the incarnate God is at the 
same time a religious and moral ideal.“ 2

It is therefore for one in the ethical aspect 
of human consciousness that we may detect the most 
original hidden germs as well as final fruition of 
religious development. It is in the gradual differenti¬ 
ation between the good and the bad that we find both 
the roots and the fruits of the god-concept. 

And if we continue our quest for that some¬ 
thing which in the first place set this differentiating 
process into motion we shall not find it in a calculating 
egoism but rather in what is known as the *we-group* 
feeling (in dem Gefuehl der Zusaramengehoerighkeit mit 
den Genosden) without which society itself could not 
possibly have originated. The social origin of ethics, 
ethical idealism, and the god-concept is thus definitely 
postulated in Wundt.' Ojit of the conflict between 
individualism and a we-group consciousness there arose 
habitual modes of action- and behaviour-patterns. The 
generating and modifying influence of the we-group 
feeling was intensified when it came to be projected 
into a super-sensuous world in which man sees fulfilled 
those ideals which appear to him to be the highest ob¬ 
jectives of all human effort,; Wundt sees a definition 
of religion. The conception of a super-sensuous world 
of which man and his immediate environment are seen as 
an integral part becomes particularly effective as a 
1. ' Ursprdmg sittlicher Triebe* 










168 


disciplining and moralizing influence when man conceives 
himself as a co-operating and co-creating factor in the 
development of such an ideal super-sensuous Kingdom of 
God. The ethical implication of such a we-group feeling 
in terms of spirit and attitude tend to become still 
more obvious with the growing indentification of a super- 
sensuous Kingdom of God with an ideal social and economic 
order here and now* 

The other root and frMt of the god-idea must 
be looked for in metaphysics* According to idealistic 
philosophy the god-idea was pre-existent to h\aman ex¬ 
perience* Experience is but the gradual unfolding of 
the Absolute and Infinite tiirough the medium of relative 
and finite minds* Platons forms did not come into ex¬ 
istence as the result of human experience* Kant^s 
*noumena^ existed before his ‘phenomena^* According to 
Hegel the Absolute and Infinite manifests itself through 
the medium of finite minds. Note, it emerges through 
the finite mind but it is not a creation of the finite 
mind. T.H* Green^ following Hegel, sees in the ^totality 
of the apprehension^ never fully attained by finite 
minds, an approach to the knowledge of an all-compre¬ 
hending, all-unifying, God. That God is the unifying 
principle underlying all diversity and that such a pre¬ 
existent immanent unity progressively revealing itself 


1 







159 - 


in the increasing comprehensiveness and subtlety of 

1 

finite mind is also the contention of F.H. Bradley. 

All seeming oposition between good and bad, truth and 
error, God and Satan, tend to become reconciled and 
harmonized in the metaphysical god of Bradley. The 
permanency of Platons contribution to the development 
of philosophical concepts becomes apparent at this 
point. In Plato we find an attempt to fuse the 
ethical and the metaphysical aspect of the god-idea. 

So also in Leibnitz. 

"In Plato the deity as the idea of The Good unites 
the highest values of knowledge ajid of virtue. 

For Leibniz God as the Monad of Monads is both 
higheist world-reason and world-organizer.” 

*^So vereinigt bei Plato die Gottheit als Idee 
des Gutfen in sich die hoechsten Gueter der 
Erkenntnis und der Tugend. Fuer Leibniz ist 
Gott als Monas monadum oberste Weltvernunft und 
Weltordner zugleich!) 2 

The germ and final fruition of the god- 
concept must therefore be sought neither exclusively 
in/%6nception of a super-sensuous world of which the 
individual with his environment believes himself to 
be a part nor exclusively in the ethical dualism of 
good and bad.

Chapter Eight ; Conclusion: The Probable Future of 

the God^Concept > 

Whether educated people today define God as 
the immanent 'elan vital* which manifests itself in 
a thousand and one forms of organic lifej or as the 
next more subtle, more comprehensive and more complex 
space-time configuration toward which the present 
highest and most complex quality of existence shows 

! a constant nisus; or as an ethical-metaphysical 
synthesis representing those values which understand¬ 
ing people consider most vital for the freest and 
fullest future development of individuals, groups and 
of the human species itself, the question inevitably 

I 

j 

i arisest Will humanity ever arrive at a point where 

i 

I it will have one God, one religion, and one socio¬ 
political order? Will the Fatherhood of God and the 
brotherhood of man ever be more than a Utopian ideal 
after which man may strive but which he will never 
attain? 

The 'increasing cohesiveness' element 
in Spencer's definition of the evolutionary process 
would have us be hopeful. And hopefulness marks the 
attitude of many who have given thought to the matter. 
Nor is this hope altogether without foundation. Wundt 
sees some justification for the term »world culture'. 














162 


World contact and consequent world inter-action is on 
the increase. Spatial barriers are being broken down. 

Universal human needs and resultant universal human 
values are increasingly objects of world-wide attention. 
The essential elements in the god-concept of the two 
world religions, Buddhism and Christianity, are very 
similar. 

**The difference between Nirvana and the Christian 
heaven is merely that, in the one case, the em¬ 
phasis falls on knowledge, whereas, in the other, 
it is placed on feeling. This distinction, 
however, is not absolute. Buddha, also, preaches 
love of one*s neighbour, indeed, sympathy with 
every suffering creature; and the Christian as 
well as the Buddist, seeks the knowledge of 
God. Moreover, ideas of purification are neces¬ 
sarily involved in redemptive religions, and 
hence are to be found in Christianity no less 
than in the world religion of the Orient, though 
in a different form. —- It was not the universal 
type of idealized manhood that v-/as in each case 
regarded as the incarnate deity, but a single 
ideal personality. This purely human deity was 
no longer bound by national ties; he was not a 
guardian of the State and a helper in strife 
with other peoples, but a god of mankind. For 
every individual he was both an ideal and a 
helper, a saviour from the imperfections and 
limitations of earthly life.^ 1 

In both cases, Christ and Buddha, the deity 
showed marked capacity for assimilation and accomodation. 
V/hich is to say that in them a growing spirit of toler¬ 
ance of man as well as a growing humaneness to humans 
manifested itself, here as elsewhere the attitude of 
man being projected upon the current conception of the

deity thus to be sanctioned and declared worthy of 
emulation* And it was and is this attitude of tolera¬ 
tion which sets these deities off from others and gives 
to them traits which may prove increasingly vital to 
their survival* In the case of the deity of Christen¬ 
dom, the deity concept fell heir to a rich inheritance 
of widely practiced cults as well as an ideology which 
was the particular contribution of Greek philosophy* 

"Christianity gained its supremacy, just as did 
Buddhism, in its own way, through a capacity to 
assimilate auxiliary mythological conceptions to 
an extent scarcely equalled by any of the previous 
religions." 1 

Another trait in both the Buddhist and the 
Christian god-concepts which Wundt regards as conditions 
of the survival of both of these god-concepts, or a 
possible fusion of them, as a world-unifying god of 
humanity, is their tendency to develop into non¬ 
personal deities. 

**The belief of Hindoo in a populous heaven of 
gods was very early displaced, in the priestly 
wisdom of India, by the idea of the »eternal, 
unchangeable* Brahma. We have here an abstract 
deity-idea from which every trace of personality 
has disappeared. — The god-idea had been 
etherealized into the abstract idea of a super- 
personal’ being. 

"Christianity underwent the same crucial changes, 
though in a different manner* In the philosophy 
of the Greeks, the personal, deity of popular 


1. Ibid., p. 503. 








164 - 


belief had been displaced by a superpersonal being. 
Plato*s*idea of the good*, the Aristotelian *nous*, 
which, as pure form, holds sway beyond the boun¬ 
daries of the world, even the Stoic Zeus as the 
representative of the teleological character of 
the world order, and, finally, the gods of 
Epicurus, conceived as indefinite forms dwelling 
in nebulous regions and unconcerned with the 
world — all manifest the same tendency to elevate 
the personal deities of the heroic age into 
super-personal beings.** 1 

The Jesus-concept was the full fruition of 
the Jahwe idea of the Israelites. The father-son 
relationship found its fullest expression in Him. 

However, 

**Cult and dogma alike testify that in this case 
also the deity came to be superpersonal ffrom an 

early period on. - Dogma cannot conceal the 

fact that it originated in philosophy, which is 
destructive of personal gods. For dogma ascribes 
attributes to the deity that are irreconcilable 
with the concept of personality. The deity is 
represented as eternal, omnipotent, all-good, 
omnipresent - in short, as infinite in all 
attributes that are held to express his nature. 

- Even though dogma may continue to maintain 

that belief in a personal god is fundamental to 
Christian faith, such a belief is nevertheless 
contradictory; the union of the idea * personal* 
and *god* must be understood as a survival 
within the era of the world religions of the 
god-idea developed by national religions.** 2 

We note then that the * increasing cohesiveness* 
aspect of the evolutionary concept leads us to be hope¬ 
ful about the development of a world-deity, in the midst 
of a world-religion, producing eventually as well as 
expressing, a world-cuJure in tthe midst of a world living

peaceably together each individual and group seeking 
its own freest and fullest self-development without 
interference and, possibly even, assisting each other 
by way of helpful cooperation, to reach their several 
ends of existence* 

However, there is the * increasing heterogeneity’ 
aspect of the evolutionary process to be considered. 

This leads Wundt to be wary about the probable even¬ 
tual complete synthesis of all god-ideas. A religion 
of the future, such as conceived by Rousseau and still 
hoped for by Kant with three articles of faith: God, 
freedom and immortality, has not met with general 
assent. Likewise the elimination of religion as hoped 
for by the left wing of free-masonry has little more 
hope of realization than the hope of Helvetius that 
all individual differences would tend to disappear 
once the growing generation became subject to universal 
education. 

”In contrast to such Utopian dreams of a religion 
of the future, reality manifests even within 
Christendom a picture of increasing differentia¬ 
tion (ein Bild zunehmender Sonderung)”. 1 

Though professedly there is but one God within 
t> 3 Roman Catholisism and one God within the various 
sections of Protestantism in reality we find a multi¬ 
plicity of widely divergent god-concepta in both of 
these camps of Christendom. Though in the former one

finds unity based on organization and central authority, 
yet as to prevailing god-ideas this unit in ’-Christendom 
shows indeed a remarkable *Anpassungsfaehigkeit* but at 
the same time, and, perhaps for that very reason, a 
veritable *Enzyclopaedie aller Religionen*, a polytheism 
richer and more varied than even the Greek pantheon. 
Within the Protestant section of Christendom it is the 
continued insistence on confessional agreement which 
tends to stand as a hindrance toward the actual 
unification of the god~idea. The probability of unific¬ 
ation is increased where leaders are content with com¬ 
mon symbols and cult practices which allow all to 
worship at the same altar but at the same time allow 
each worshipper to interpret the symbols and rites as 
his own iBvel of intelligence permits him to do. How¬ 
ever, speaking of the probable unification of the god- 
idea, 

”Such hopes contradict both the psychology of 
the individual character as well as folk-psy¬ 
chology. Roth teach us that not unification 
but increasing differentiation is the way of 
all religious development.” 1 

And the only glimmer of hope therefore, lies 
in the direction of a peaceful living together 
(friedliches Nebeneinander) . 

We have made an attempt to trace the develop¬ 
ment of the god-concept as elaborated in Wilhelm Wundt’s 
Voelkerpsychologie, more particularly those three 


1. Ibid., p* 544. 






167 


volumes v^hich ..deal with * Mythus und Religion*. We have 
utilized also Wundt’s own summary of his theory as 
elaborated in his ’’Elements of Folk Psychology**. 

In attempting a summa summarium of this en¬ 
deavour we would note particularly the following: The 
god-concept, too, as one aspect of world evolution, 
is the product of gradual evolution. The attempt to 
analize the god-idea genetically is of comparatively 
recent origin being but one phase of- this scientific 
age which has become permeated with the concept of 
evolution. The generation and development of the god- 
I concept is subject to law, much as is biological 
I evolution. Reason and intellect alone are inadequate 
to trace the evolutionary process. In harmony with 
the more or less generally accepted principles of evolu¬ 
tion, progress from the simple to the complex, from 
the material to the spiritual, from homogenity to 
heterogeneity not inconsistent however with increasing 
cohesiveness and universality and self-consistency, is 
noticeable also in the development of the god-concept. 

Many attempts to trace the origin and development of 
the god-idea have failed because of one-sidedness and 
because of too great reliance upon reason aid intellect 
alone. The ’mythen-bildende Phantasie’ as well as 
cult practices have been generating, modifying, and 








168 - 


assimilating factors in the development of the god-idea. 
The relationship between these and the god-idea, as well 
as the genetic relationship between man and his gods, 
cannot be adequately indicated except with the help 
of the concept of interaction. A creature and creator 
role, a creation and creator status must be assigned 
to each. Gods are a comparatively late creation. 

Though cultless deities, and godless cults are known 
at both ends of the developmental series, nevertheless, 
gods emerge with the cults and they mirror a stage of 
culture in which food-producing has come to take the 
place of food-gathering, Gods are a synthesis of the 
demon-and the hero-concepts, each of these having 

I 

1 

contributed elements indispensible to the god-idea. 

Under the influence of a growing ethical consciousness 
as well as metaphysical speculation the process of 
development in the direction of universality and 
eventual synthesis of all god-ideas has been fostered. 
The growing differentiation in human needs and wants 
will continue tto stand in tthe way of a realization of 
the pious one-shepherd and one-flock ideal. In a 
growing inward^^ness, in the development of the spirit 
of tolerance, and in the development of the art of 
living peaceably together as well as in the art of 
helping others to a realization of their hopes and

aspirations, lies the hope of unity and peace in the 
midst of diversity and conflict* 

Everywhere and essentially it must be 
remembered, however, that the gods are projections of 
human hopes and fears. They are one phase of man*s 
belief that he with his environment is part of sin all" 
comprehensive super-sensuous order in which he believes 
his unfilled wishes and unattained goals to be realized. 

If any effective criticism were to be made of 
the manner in which Wundt elaborated the development 
of the god-concept it would not be directed against 
his thesis that the god-idea is the product of an 
ascending development; nor against the thesis that it 
is ^die belebende Apperzeption die das eigane seelische 

j 

I Leben in die Objecte hineintraegt*; nor against the 
contention that, though 

*^das reflectierende Denken auch ohne Zweifel mit 
zu den Erscheinungen gehoert aus denen sich die 
geistige^i Welt ausammensteilt,” 

nevertheless, it is not the intellect but the feelings, 

witi? a 

the hopes and the fears together/will which is directed 
toward the satisfaction of those emotions which forms 
the ^fons et origo^ of all ideas. 

It might be suggested, however, that a physio- 
psychical parallelism such as underlies Wundt^s entire 
labour is an attempt to straddle the issue between 










- 170 - 

materialism and spiritualism, 

”V/undt has assumed a peculiar view concerning the 
psycho-physical parallelism. Like many others he 
does not only limit the psychic series to the brain 
functions, but also makes the psychic go beyond 
the physical, by assuming that certain synthetic 
functions of our mind take place in the brain 
without parallel processes. This is an inconsis¬ 
tency which it is not only impossible to prove, 
but which, among other things, is opposed by the 
fact that we have an alalogous synthesis in the 
physical sphere. 1 

Again, we have indicated at the beginning of 
this essay that an understanding of Hume's associational 
psychology is essential for an understanding of Wundt. 
The validity of conclusions based on this hypothesis of 
the origin and development of ideas is today questioned 
by psychologists of merit. It is particularly the 
•"Gestalt* psychology of the so-called Würzburger Schule 
who contend that there has been "eine fast voellige 
Abwendung von der Associations-psychologie”. 2 

Likewise, a renewed observation of the ways 
of nature appears to have revealed that progress and 
development is not always and not necessarily subject 
to law, as Wundt definitely postulates, but breaks 
and'jumps* do occur, both at the physical as well as 
at the psychical level of existence. The fact that 
•cataclysmic changes* have taken place would seem to 
make conelusions based on a 'unilinear* theory of 
development somewhat doubtful,

Nevertheless, the service rendered by Wundt 
in the development of experimental psychology has 
abiding value. 

^Despite all and even if all our misgivings and 
criticisms are true and more than true amd even 
if there are more defects, we have to conclude 
in a collapsing v/ay that after all and despite 
all, psychology owes to Wundt a debt far greater 
than to any other man living or dead and the 
more we know and understand him, the more this 
sense of obligation to him will increase.” 1 

As father of experimental psychology »^^undt 

has contributed richly to the development of the 

psychological study of religion. 

*^The impetus which Professor Wundt has given to 
the philosophical and psychological studies of 
recent years is a matter of common knowledge. 

Many of those who are contributing richly to 
these fields of thought received their stimulus 
from instruction directly enjoyed by the labora¬ 
tory and the classrooms of LeipsicV 2 

Wundt’s distinction among the ’maerchen', 
’saga’, and ’legende’ types of mythological representa¬ 
tions has shed much light on the evolution of human 
mentality. He has thereby also supplied us with a 
fairly reliable standard by which to measure and clas¬ 
sify various types and levels of mentality today. His 
criticism of rationalistic and constructive theories 
of mental evolution has taught us to be wary of all but 
truly psychological interpretations of human beliefs

and customs. He has effectively directed attention to 
the existence, nature and function of the collective 
mind. He made investigators aware of the pre-eminence 
of the affective and conative aspects of human cons¬ 
ciousness. In the attainment of the goal which he had 
set himself in the “Voelkerpsychologie'*, to unxzover 
laws that underly mental development, he has supplied 
us with serviceable principles of interpretation of 
the individual and social mind. 

As to my personal debt to '»^undt, it goes al¬ 
most without saying that a prolonged reading of Wundt 
has given me additional inspiration and training in 
going in quest of ^quaecumque vera* with an unbiased 
mind and in an objective way, and it has induced me to 
give such newly discovered verities a place in my 
*’V^eltanschauung” even though such truths seemed at 
first distasteful and not in harmony with previously 
entertained conceptions. The reading and re-reading 
of Wundt is a sort of liberal education in itself. 
While I have become, perhaps, somewhat less tolerant 
of survival elements in present-day religious beliefs 
and practices, I have become,, I believe, somewhat 
more tolerant of those who innocently cling to such^ 
survival elements in our social and cultural inheri¬ 
tance, as well as with those who tend to become im¬ 
patient with the cultural laggards. Certainly, the 






173 


reading of Wundt*s ’Mythus and Religion* has enabled 
me to evaluate in a more disinterested way various 
elements in religion as it is believed in and practiced 
today• What is equally if not more important still, 
it has provided me with an incentive toward the re¬ 
examination of my own conception of God and with guidance 
toward a conception of God which is less inconsistent 
with known facts about the universe and more in 
harmony with intelligent guesses about the nature of 
Ultimate Reality*
