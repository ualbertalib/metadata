A STUDY ON WINTER HARDINESS OF 
ROSES 


INTRODUCTION 

A serious drawback to the successful outdoor 
oulture of garden roses in Alberta is the heavy loss 
that occurs due to winter killing. A study has been 
made of a number of different wintering methods in 
an effort to determine the most satisfactory pro¬ 
cedure. 

The project was laid out as a thesis subject 
at the University of Alberta, was authorized by the 
Dominion Experimental Farm system as part of the 
regular work, and was begun at the Experimental Sta¬ 
tion, Beaverlodge, Alberta, in the spring of 1938. 

Although several classes of roses such as 
Rugosas, Hybrid Rugosas, and perhaps Hybrid Per¬ 
petual s , can be grown with but little winter pro¬ 
tection, the general equality of the more tender 
Hybrid Tea group is generally considered to be 
superior, and it is varieties of this type that 
people wish most to grow in their gardens. In 
this test the emphasis was placed on varieties of

the Hybrid Tea group. 

LITERATURE REVIEW ON WINTER HARDINESS 

Winter hardiness and its physiological basis 
is indeed a large subject. The extent of the liter¬ 
ature up to 1935 is shown by Harvey (7) in his 
"Annotated Bibliography of the Low Temperature 
Relations of Plants", in which he lists 3,412 
references. A second edition published a year 
later lists an additional 250 references, and does 
not include all those actually published during 
that short interval. An attempt has been made to 
study the literature with the viewpoint of organ¬ 
izing the material in suitable relation to the 
research work on which this thesis subject is based. 

1. THEORIES AS TO HOW FREEZING KILLS 
Killing Above the Freezing Point 

According to Wiegand (21), certain plants 
and plant tissues may be killed by cold above the 
freezing point. The explanation is that oxygen 
absorption proceeds much faster than the elimin- 














-3- 


ation of carbon dioxide and there are other dis¬ 
turbances to a sensitive balance between various 
vital processes that lead to the accumulation of 
toxic products within the cells. 

Killing Below the Freezing Point 
Nature of protoplasm *- Chandler (2) has stated 
that a significant feature related to differences 
in resistance of tissues to low temperature is the 
difference in the nature or composition of the 
protoplasm. He believed that pentosans, other 
colloidal substances, and fats in combination, play 
a role in increasing the hardiness of the tissues 
by increasing the colloidal stability of the 
protoplasm. 

Denaturation and coagulation of protoplasm .- 
Muller-Thurgau (16) was of the opinion that death 
by freezing is due to a denaturing of the proto¬ 
plasm caused by drying, as water moves to the 
intercellular spaces to form ice masses. 

However, Maximow (12, 13) obtained data 
which seemed to disprove this viewpoint, and 
Chandler and Hildreth (3) sum up his refutation. 
Maximow froze tissue in air, water and various 













t 


t 















-4- 


organic and inorganic compounds. Some of the in¬ 
organic solutions were of a kind that will denature 
protein colloidal solutions, but strangely, they, 
as well as concentrations of sap, protected the 
protoplasm during freezing instead of being the 
oause of injury* Further, it seemed certain, that 
a solution concentrated enough to hold seme water 
unfrozen at a given temperature will remove as much 
water from the protoplasm by osmosis as will be 
removed to form ice at that temperature in sections 
frozen in water or in air. However, these sections 
withstood further concentration by ice formation 
at more than 20° C. below what would be the killing 
temperature of the sections if frozen in water or 
in air. 

An outstanding characteristic of protoplasm 
is its colloidal nature; and on death from freezing 
or from any other cause, this collodial system is so 
disturbed that its usual characteristics, par¬ 
ticularly as regards hydration and permeability, 
are radically changed. In this connection, the 
conclusions of Lepeschkin (9, 10) regarding the 
action of freezing on protoplasm seem to have been 










-5- 


almost ignored by investigators on freezing injury 
to plants. He emphasized the extreme sensitivity 
of protoplasm to coagulation by mechanical action. 
He believed that in both freezing and drying there 
is a strong mechanical action on the protoplasm 
through shrinking of the cell, and that this 
mechanical action effects a disorganization of the 
protoplasmic structure# In addition, he held 
that during freezing, there is a strong mechanical 
aotion through pressure of the ice mass either 
within or without the cell which produces a mech¬ 
anical coagulation of the protoplasm# 

The fact that ice masses become larger 
and more rigid as temperature falls and may 
eventually penetrate or exert considerable 
pressure on the protoplasm, seemed to Chandler 
and Hildreth (3) worthy of special attention, so 
they began experiments using pollen as the living 
tissue, subjecting it to low temperatures under 
different environments. Their data supported 
Maximow’s view (12, 13) that killing of protoplasm 
at low temperature is not due to the concentration 
or changing of the sap caused by freezing out of 












6 - 


the water, but is due to a direct effect of the 
ice masses* Their data were not conclusive proof 
of this, but if their pollen was killed by the 
same processes as protoplasm of other plant tissue, 
killing by freezing could not have been due (a) 
to injurious concentrations of the sap, (b) to 
changes in its composition at eutectic points, 

(c) to any other purely chemical influence, or 

(d) to the denaturing of the protoplasm by the 
withdrawal of water* They concluded that death 
may have been due to a coagulation of the proto¬ 
plasm caused directly by the crystals, or possibly 
a denaturation of the protoplasm around water 
masses introduced at thawing from penetrating 
crystals. 

Rupture of the protoplasm ,- Maximow 1 s views (12, 
13 ) on the mechanism of killing by freezing were 
concerned with the rupture of the protoplasm. 

He believed that pressure of the ice masses on 
the protoplasmic membrane caused cracks which per¬ 
mit extrusion of cell contents* 

Plasmolysis .- Gardner, Bradford and Hooker (5) 























- 7 - 


asoribed death of tissue to withdrawal of water 
from the cell, a process comparable to death by 
plasmolysis, and set forth the order of processes 
that occur in regards to killing by freezing. The 
first evident step is a contraction of the proto¬ 
plasm and the appearance of water in the inter¬ 
cellular spaoes where it has been forced or drawn 
from the cell. Ice formation begins at various 
points in the intercellular spaces, frequently 
making lens-shaped masses of hexagonal crystals 
which are larger at the side that draws on the 
greater number of cells. As the enlarging ice 
needles deplete the water of the intercellular 
spaoes, more is drawn from the cell contents. 

The continuance of this process, however, makes 
the sap remaining within the cells more concen¬ 
trated and thus increases "the force with which 
the remaining quantities of water are held." A 
still stronger force, operating as a reserve, is 
that known as molecular capillarity, holding with 
extreme tenacity a certain amount of water of 
imbibition. Thence, it is with increasing dif¬ 
ficulty that ice formation continues and it must 















- 8 - 


cease sooner or later unless the temperature be 
lowered further. Moreover, the very process of 
solidification liberates a certain amount of heat. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that, as the temper¬ 
ature falls, the ice formation for each degree 
becomes progressively less. As the ice crystals 
increase, the cell walls collapse and become 
packed together in dense masses. Buds and bark 
of hardy trees show this condition, as also do 
evergreen leaves, but at suitable temperatures 
they expand, draw back the water and become normal. 

In summing up the effects of plasmolysis, 
Miller (14) was of the opinion that killing by 
cold depends, in some cases at least, on ice 
formation rather than on the direct effect of low 
temperature. The withdrawal of water from the 
oell by freezing, according to him may bring 
about death from the following causes; (1) 
desicoation of the protoplasm; (2) mechanical 
injury to the protoplasmic membrane; and, (3) 
precipitation of proteins by salting out due to 
the greater concentration of salts in the sap or 










►9 


to its increase in acidity as water is withdrawn. 
Freezing and the deciduous habit .- The view that 
death from low temperature is due to a withdrawal 
of water is supported by the consideration that 
the deciduous habit is in most cases essentially 
a protection against water loss during the winter 
and that the leaves of evergreen plants are par¬ 
ticularly adapted to reduce the rate of trans¬ 
piration to a minimum. 

Concentration of sap *- Gorke (6) was of the 
opinion that the injury is due to the sap con¬ 
centration, together with the going out of 
solution of some substances at their eutectic 
points so that the protoplasm is left without 
the protection of certain substances that stay 
in solution. 

Ice formation .- Wiegand (21) stated that most 
plants are killed by the first ice formation 
within the tissues. If any survive, a consider¬ 
ably lower temperature is required to kill them 
or they may be capable of enduring any degree of 
cold. In the case of delicate tissues at least, 























10 - 


death ooours when the ioe formation has progressed 
to a certain extent* Death seems due to the actual 
withdrawal of water to form ice, not to the cold* 
The ice formation dries out the cells and the plant 
suffer as a result of drought conditions* 

A problem of metabolism ** A different aspect of 
the situation was brought out by Miller (14), re¬ 
ferring to a paper by Schnaffnit and Ludtke (19) 
who oonsidered that death of a plant from frost 
or heat is a problem of metabolism. The entire 
process of metabolism need not be suspended. The 
cessation of activity of only one enzyme may be 
sufficient to cause death. 

2. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT 
OF INJURY 

Harmful and Useful Actions 
Much work on winter hardiness, and its 
physiological basis, has been done by Russian 
workers in recent years. Firsthand access to 
their researoh work is not available to invest¬ 
igators on this continent, so that a treatise by 
a well known Russian worker such as I. I* Tumanov, 





























11 - 


who Is in intimate contact with this type of work 
in his country is very valuable for a summation 
of its present status. He has recently published 
a book, "The Physiological Basis of Winter Hardi¬ 
ness in Cultivated Plants", Seljholzig, Leningrad, 
1940. A short review of this book (22) in English 
is the source of the information presented here. 

In order to successfully protect a plant 
from adverse winter conditions, the relations of 
the plant to the seasonal element of winter must 
be known. The external environment exerts, on 
the one hand, an adverse effect which may damage 
or even kill the plant, and, on the other hand, a 
beneficial action which increases resistance to 
the harmful action of winter conditions. The 
wintering of a plant, therefore, is a balance 

struck between harmful and useful actions. We 

■ 

must know how to measure and utilize this bal¬ 
ance. It was on this basis that the work in the 
book under review was planned and the material 
available to the author was arranged. 

According to Tumanov, the main harmful 


















-12 


actions that ocour in wintering plants are as 
follows: 

(1) The pressure of ice on considerably de¬ 
hydrated cells (freezing and destruction 
under an ice crust). 

(2) Starvation of plants (exhaustion). 

(3) Drying (winter dehydration and moisture de¬ 
ficiency during spring drought in plants 
damaged or heaved during winter)* 

(4) Damage and destruction due to lack of exygen 
(soaking of germinated seeds and injured 
plants). 

(3) Interference with normal metabolism associated 
with disintegration processes prevailing over 
synthetic processes (destruction of certain 
. plants at temperatures slightly above the 
freezing point). 

Investigations of wintering of plants are 
complicated by the fact that, during the cold 
season, different sequences and combinations of 
harmful actions occur; for instance, frost injured 
plants may later suffer from soaking or, on the 
















-13- 


oontrary, from drying; excess of moisture may be 
combined with ice formation, heaving with drying, 
or exposure, etc#. 

Maturity or Hardening and Relation 
of Rest Period 

Hardening is closely associated with the 
maturity of the tissue. Maturity at the advent 
of the rest period is likewise important. There 
is close association among all of these factors. 
Phases in the hardening of plants .- A distinct 
feature of the Soviet research is the splitting up 
of the complex process of wintering. Tumanov, and 
others, have been able to establish two ecologically 
and physiologically distinct phases in the harden¬ 
ing of plants and, in their main outlines, the 
factors concerned therein, with the result that, 
in hardening under laboratory conditions, plants 
may now attain as high a frost resistance as they 
would in the open. It must be remembered that in 
the western European and American research, by 
hardening, is understood only the first of these 
two phases. The investigations of Tumanov and his 
associates show that the first phase of hardening 








t 








-14- 


is acquired by winter plants at 0 to 6 ° C. in 
light; apparently, the upper limit is determined 
by temperatures at which growth becomes more or 
less pronounced. The second phase of hardening is 
acquired only under much lower temperatures, about 
-2 to -3° C# and is evidently based upon different 
physiological processes. The frost resistance ac¬ 
quired during the first phase of hardening is not 
generally very high, but it is conspicuously in¬ 
creased as a result of the second phase of harden¬ 
ing. For instance, in wheat, the percentage of 
survival was increased from 17 at - 13 ° 0 . after the 
first phase of hardening to 96 at -17° C. after the 
second phase. Since the second phase may begin 
and proceed only when, and if, the first phase has 
been completed, it is obvious that dehydration of 
tissues and low temperatures may become effective 
only in the presence of the protective substances, 
and as we shall see later, while the plant is in a 
certain physiological state, or, more precisely, at 
a definite developmental phase. 

As Newton (17) has pointed out, there are 









-15- 


two steps in the scheme of hardening for winter 
where protective forces come into play, one in 
preventing the water outgo from the cell, the 
other in preventing disorganization of the pro¬ 
toplasm. Around these two points have developed 
two schools of thought on hardiness, the one 
attributing cold resistance to the cell’s ability 
to limit the amount of water frozen out; the other 
being not so much concerned with preventing excess 
water loss from the cell contents as with the 
immunity of the protoplasm to the effects of water 
loss* 

Hardening in woody plants *- The "hardening" of 
woody plants is somewhat different from that pre¬ 
viously discussed for other kinds, as the ac¬ 
cumulation of starch usually begins in them in 
late summer when their growth is much reduced. On 
converting starch into protective substances during 
the autumn, woody plants also enter the second 
phase of hardening at still lower temperatures. 

The existence of the second phase has, however, 
been demonstrated so far in experiments with plants 


















."0 











- 16 - 


which form sugars, and it still remains to be seen 
whether the second phase of hardening is required 
at all by woody plants in which oils and not sugars 
are the protective substances. 

Reversibility of hardening .- An interesting side¬ 
light brought out by Tumanov which somewhat il¬ 
luminates the field of spring killing was his state¬ 
ment that hardening of plants is a reversible process, 
and evidently hardening is very easily lost when the 
thaw begins. However, if temperatures during the 
thaw are not too high the plants may retain the 
first phase of hardening, in which case they may, 
under favourable conditions, regain the second 
phase. 

Protoplasmic changes in hardening .- Scarth and 
Levitt (18) sum up protoplasmic changes re the 
frost-hardening mechanism of plants with the 
statement that the most pronounced and unmistakable 
changes in the protoplasm are increased osmotic 
pressure and (in trees) non-solvent space. Ways 
are suggested in which all of these protect the 
cells against mechanical injury due to frost.

Frost Resistance and Sugar Content 
The results so far obtained by various in¬ 
vestigators working on the relation of sugar content 
to hardiness, have failed to disclose the nature of 
hardening; however, certain factors have been 
clarified. Workers maintain there is a connection 
between frost resistance and sugar content, but 
this feature has proved to be much more complicated 
than was thought to be the case in early investi¬ 
gations, where a direct correlation between some 
properties and frost resistance was sought. 

Increases in sugar content of plants on 
exposure to low temperatures have been observed 
by many workers. Lidforss (11) was perhaps the 
first to offer a plausible explanation of the sig¬ 
nificance of this transformation. He showed 
experimentally that sugars have the ability to 
protect proteins from precipitation on freezing, 
and concluded that in some manner the increase of 
sugars in plants toward winter serves as an ad¬ 
aptation to low temperatures* 

Hildreth (8) promulgated the theory that 










- 18 - 


sugars are not of as great significance in the 
matter as was first believed by certain workers# 

He concluded, after experiments with artificial 
freezing, that neither moisture content, sugars, 
pentosans, nor amino-nitrogen, offered a reliable 
basis for separating hardy and tender varieties of 
apples. There was some indication that high re¬ 
serves of carbohydrates and of organic nitrogen 
might be correlated with greater hardiness* 
Duration of the Low Temperature 
Chandler (1) has said, in a textbook, that 
since in nature, temperatures below freezing 
but above the killing temperature do no harm, 
it is evident that, with parts above the surface 
of the soil, it is not necessarily the long cold 
winter that does the harm but the winter with the 
single cold night; even if the remainder of the 
winter is rather mild, Hildreth (8) reports that 
degree of cold injury is directly proportional 
to the duration of exposure to a given temperature* 
This was concluded on the basis of results with 
artificial freezing. With roots, the long cold 









19- 


period is the more injurious, because it requires 
a considerable time for the soil to become very 
cold down to the zone of the tree roots. 

Rapidity of Temperature Rise and Fall 

Wiegand (21) intimated it is common know¬ 
ledge that certain woody plants can stand a much 
lower temperature if the lowering to that point 
is gradual than if it is sudden, and Hildreth (8) 
mentioned that a rapid fall in temperature above 
the killing point is more injurious than gradual 
lowering. However, the rate of fall in nature 
may not be so great as to make the point of much 
significance. 

Under conditions such as exist at Beaver- 
lodge, there may be reason for making an issue of 
Hildreth’s statement. Chinooks sometimes effect 
sudden changes of temperature of some considerable 
extent, in which case it is thought that the rate 
of temperature fall may be so great as to be an 
important factor. 

As already indicated, it can be shown 
definitely, in certain oases at least, that death 









■y ' *■ • • •• 



















- 20 - 




has occurred before any thawing begins. This 
being the case, there would be no effect of slow 
or rapid thawing* 

Chandler and Hildreth (3) pointed out, 
further, that the harmful effect of very rapid 
thawing noted by previous workers is not explained 
satisfactorily by any theory of ice pressure or 
desiccation, because the pressure and location 
of the ice mass, and the amount of desiccation 
by freezing are not greater whether thawing is 
slow or rapid# 

Coagulation of the protoplasmic colloids 
affords a plausible basis of explanation of the 
injury from rapid thawing. To reverse the process 
of coagulation and to again disperse the coagulated 
particles requires time. It may be assumed, on 
the basis of Lepeschkin»s theory, that freezing 
at temperatures above the killing point produces 
some reversible coagulation. If thawing is slow 
enough to allow this dispersal to take place as 
rapidly as water is melted from the crystals, the 
protoplasm resumes its normal colloidal character- 












- 21 - 


istios. However, if thawing is so rapid that dis¬ 
persal oannot keep paoe with it, the normal 
properties of protoplasm with regard to permeability 
no longer exist. Extrusion of solutes and abnormal 
penetration of oxygen could occur, which might 
result in harmful chemical changes in the con¬ 
stituents of the cell. Such chemical changes would, 
of course, be accelerated by the rise in temperature, 
because such absorption phenomena generally have a 
negative temperature coefficient. 

Moisture Conditions 

Moisture on the surface of the plant usually 
increases the amount of damage caused by a temper¬ 
ature near the killing point, according to 
Chandler (1). There is evidence from freezing 
experiments conducted in the laboratory, that 
leaves as well as flowers and young fruits will 
be injured more by a given temperature if the 
surface is wet when subjected to freezing. How¬ 
ever, it must be kept in mind that, under seme 
conditions, tissues may become dry enough during 
winter to be killed. Such killing is a drying 






























- 22 - 


to death rather than a freezing to death and is 
concerned with a different set of factors. 

Chandler (2) took the viewpoint that tissues 
may be killed in winter not by freezing to death 
but by drying to death. If the roots are frozen 
during long periods and the water from the soil 
cannot replace that lost by evaporation from the 
twigs, unless there is a very large reserve in 
the trunks or branches made available by brief 
periods when the wood is thawed, the twigs may 
eventually dry to death. Such drying to death, 
however, would not be determined by the temper¬ 
ature in a single cold night. In fact, if the 
tissues were badly dried but alive, it is 
probable that their resistance to such a cold 
night would be greater than if fully turgid. 

Drying to death, it would seem, would be deter¬ 
mined by the length of the period during which 
the soil was frozen, and by the conditions for 
evaporation such as the amount of sunshine, 
finerson, in unpublished work, found the killing 
of raspberries in Nebraska, often at least if not 













. 



















c 












23- 


always, to be a drying to death. Thus, when he 
coated the canes with paraffin, they survived 
winters that killed uncovered canes. Such a 
covering would tend to protect from freezing to 
death succulent tissue that kills at but a few 
degrees below the freezing point of water. It 
does not seem, however, that it could protect 
such resistant winter tissue from direct freezing 
to death. That it should protect if from drying 
to death is evident. 

The work of Snerson, reported by Chandler 
(2), is believed to be of considerable significance 
in relation to this study of rose wintering, par¬ 
ticularly in relation to the wax treatment. Re¬ 
sults with the waxing treatment reported herein 
gave markedly superior results. It is believed 
that in view of this fact, killing of the roses 
very likely may have been due to drying to death 
rather than to freezing to death. If winter- 
killing can be established as due to drying to 
death, methods of protecting against this killing, 
















-24- 


points the direction of further research. 

Probably waxing after pruning in the autumn would 
give as good results as waxing without pruning, 
this being accomplished by means of a special 
spray apparatus. Pruning before waxing might even 
make the treatment a practical one for rose growers. 

Shoemaker (20) indicated similar results 
in his statement that observations in Missouri 
and Colorado, where canes survived the lowest 
temperature of the winter and later dried out, 
enoouraged the belief that injury in the red 
raspberry is not due to typical freezing to 
death but rather to death from physiological 
drought* 

Some degree of protection is afforded 
plants by watering the soil freely in the prox¬ 
imity of the roots in the autumn. This fall ir¬ 
rigation practice is recognized for use in re¬ 
ducing winter killing of raspberries, and has 
been used to some extent for the protection of 
trees and shrubs. If the killing of roses in the 
test is a drying to death, autumn irrigation 
might be helpful.

Effect of Sunlight 

Although Chandler (2) did not find any 
evidence that sunlight is injurious to frozen 
leaves, blossoms, fruits and other tissues of 
deciduous fruit trees, he thought that there 
would hardly be justification for concluding it 
may not be slightly injurious to tissue of some 
kinds of plants. He said further (1) that if 
there is effect of sunlight, it seems to be small 
compared with other influences. 

3. ARTIFICIAL TESTS OF HARDINESS 
The Russian viewpoint (22) on artificial 
methods for testing hardiness is that despite 
many shortcomings and the clumsiness of the field 
method, it is gaining or rather regaining ground. 
This statement has Tumanov as an authority. 

The Dye-adsorption Test 
Dunn (4) summed up the situation with 
respect to the dye-adsorption test by stating 
that none of the methods so far developed can be 
used with certainty to determine hardiness in a 
practical way as a substitute for a natural or 















26- 


artifioial freezing test* The dye-adsorption 
test as used by him involved calorimetric measure¬ 
ment of colloid content of plant tissues which had 
previously shown some promise as a measure of cold 
hardiness, further work being undertaken to deter¬ 
mine it accurately in predicting hardiness in 
advance of freezing. 

Artificial Freezing 

Another, perhaps less artificial, method 
for testing hardiness was used by Hildreth (8) 
where plant parts were exposed to low temperatures 
under conditions of refrigeration. The apparatus 
consisted essentially of an ammonia compressor 
and an insulated chamber cooled by the direct ex¬ 
pansion of ammonia into coils lining the walls, 
and capable of producing temperatures below -40° 

C. It was equipped with automatic temperature 
controls and also a device for varying the temper¬ 
ature at any desired rate. For the most part, 
control of ±0.6 C. of the desired temperature was 
possible; however, for temperatures around **40° C., 
fluctuations of ±1° C. usually occurred. Material

to be frozen was placed loosely on wooden racks 
in the freezing chamber and carefully insulated 
from the coils. The air in the chamber was con¬ 
stantly stirred by an electric fan. Temperature 
control was verified by thermographic records. The 
material used for the tests in this particular case 
was the terminal growth of the previous season. 

With this apparatus, Hildreth tested the 
hardiness of apple varieties. Classifying these 
varieties, which were of known hardiness, he found 
that the order of hardiness indicated by artificial 
freezing, agreed with their hardiness as shown by 
field experience. Hildreth thought that the use 
of this test in determining hardiness of seedlings 
and varieties of unknown cold resistance seemed 
practical. The apparatus proved valuable for ex¬ 
periments on winter hardiness as well. 

4. PRESENT STATUS OF HARDINESS 
INVESTIGATIONS 

It is evident that the actual cause of 
death from winter killing is not known. Most 
probably, interference with the normal properties 











28- 


of the protoplasm in the cell is responsible, due 
to one or more of a number of possible factors, 
but authorities are not in agreement on this point. 

Although the actual causes of death are not 
known, workers, through years of research, have 
learned much concerning factors that influence the 
amount of injury in winter killing# Rate of 
temperature change, especially in proximity to the 
killing point, evidently is of great importance, 
since it is closely related to the attaining of 
winter hardiness by plants. 

This theory is closely tied in with the 
work on phasic development. Research in this 
field is being led by Soviet workers and results 
available in the English language, lag behind the 
work. The exact present status is consequently 
difficult to evaluate. 

Moisture relations are also of significance 
since it has been shown that killing is sometimes 
due to drying to death. 

Research work continues. New theories 
appear. An attempt has been made to study and 












-29- 


evaluate the present most generally held theories 
oonoerning this interesting but conjectural field. 

BOTIR01MMTAL FACTORS 

Location .- Beaverlodge, although in the southern 
part of the Peace River country, at a latitude of 
55° 10 f and an altitude of about 2,500 feet, is 
fairly representative of conditions in the Peace 
River area. It is perhaps slightly less frosty 
than average, the Experimental Station itself be¬ 
ing looated on a hill. The actual location of 
the test plots was on the east slope of the hill, 
near the top. These plots were protected on the 
west by a saskatoon hedge, crabapple trees and 
currant bushes. However, they were not protected 
to the south and east but the north wind was 
broken by buildings and corrals about 55 yards 
distant. 

Climate and weather .- Temperature and pre¬ 
cipitation records might have a bearing on the 
results obtained from the wintering tests, so

for comparison, the meteorological records for 
1938 to 1940 as well as the 23 -year average, are 
here presented (Table I). 

Examination of the data in Table I shows 
a lower than average precipitation in the months 
of April, May and July of 1938, and in August and 
September of 1940. The low August precipitation 
is given consideration in evaluating the fertilizer 
responses. 

Examination of the mean monthly temperature 
records shows nothing out of the ordinary, at least 
nothing that could apparently have any effect on 
this test. 

The years during which the rose wintering 
tests have been in operation have been nearly normal 
in regards to weather. If anything, the seasons 
1938 and 1940 have been a trifle on the dry side, 
which might adversely affect the results of the 
various treatments in the fertilizer portion of 
the test in 1940. This comparatively low pre¬ 
cipitation may have prevented adequate utilization 
of the fertilizers, at least to some extent, so 











■ 32 * 


that perhaps the results of this test are not a 
true picture of the normal response of fertilizers. 
However, this difficulty was overcome by watering- 
in the fertilizer artificially when it did not 
rain at the appropriate time. This artificial 
watering may not, on the other hand, have had the 
same effect as if there had been natural pre¬ 
cipitation. 

Soil .- This Beaverlodge clay loam soil, on which 
the rose test was conducted, belongs to the gray- 
black transitional or incipient podsolic soil zone. 
The rose wintering test, however, was located on 
garden soil which had been manured annually for a 
number of years previously, so that it could 
hardly be expected that there would be any marked 
deficiency of any of the elements, even though the 
area was cropped every year. Thus, the elements 
applied as fertilizers may not have had much effect 
due to an already adequate supply of the necessary 
nutrients. If this were the case, the effect of 
the liquid manures, two of the three giving superior 















33- 


wintering, oould be explained as the effect of the 
water in the manure treatment. 

Fertilizers .- It was expected that some of the 
fertilizers might have induced ripening of the wood 
to suoh an extent that bushes would have wintered 
more satisfactorily than the untreated plots, but 
this did not prove to be the oase. However, there 
was an indication that the fertilizer treatments 
in which nitrogen was included gave less satis¬ 
factory wintering in all cases except the liquid 
manure treatment. It was expected that this would 
be the case since nitrogen usually induces succulent 
growth which does not winter well. 

Yarietal-wintering test .- The results from the 1938 
test are complete, it having been carried through 
two winters, but the 1939 test will not be complete 
until the autumn of 1941. The treatments in the 
two years * plantings, 1938 and 1939, were nearly 
the same, the only difference being the addition 
of the waxing treatment in 1939* Results for these 
two tests are thought to be fair indications of 
what would happen over a long period if more data 











■ ’■ ■ - 

a 










- 34 - 


were available. The severity of the winters during 
which the tests were conducted was about average 
or perhaps not quite so severe as might be expected 
in the average winter. They were certainly not 
severe test winters. 

The objective in the varietal-wintering and 
the fertilizer-wintering tests was to find some 
more satisfactory wintering method than is now 
generally practised. Average data for the eight 
varieties in each of the two varietal-wintering 
tests were recorded for each of the four or five 
wintering methods, varietal differences not being 
considered. The fertilizer-wintering tests were 
left in situ o utside, mounded with a foot of soil 
and mulched with several inches of straw. 

In further discussion, the terms varietal- 
and fertilizer-wintering tests, distinguish the 
two main treatments. The year in the title of a 
test indicates the year of planting of the rose 
bushes. Each test was, or is to be, wintered 
twice. 






























-35- 

DESCRIPTION OF THK PLOTS 


General plan *- The disposition of the various 
wintering tests is shown in Figure I. As previously 
mentioned, there is a fairly good windbreak along 
the west side of the experimental plots* The roses 
were planted in 11 rows running north and south, 

97 plants in each row or a total of 1,067 rose 
bushes in the plots. About the middle of the range, 
a foot path divides the plot into two sections. 

The bushes were planted 3 feet apart each way, at 
this spacing there being little flank effect of 
one bush on another. Furthexmore, this treatment 
permitted horse cultivation, with a one horse 
cultivator# 

1938 Varietal-wintering test .- This part of the 
test consisted of 252 bushes, exactly fitting the 
west 6 rows of the north section of the plot# 

Twelve bushes on the north end were extras, being 
remnants of the 8 varieties. There were 30 bushes 
of each of the following varieties: (A) Avooa, 

(B) Admiration, (C) Mrs. G. A. Van Rossem, (D) 

Rex Anderson, (E) Felbergts Rosa Druschki,

(F) Souvenir de Cl. Pernet, (G) Prinoe C. de Rohan, 
(H) British Queen. These varieties were planted from 
south to north in this plot, with 5 plants in eaoh 
of the 6 rows of each variety, and the varieties 
planted in the order listed above, A* B, C, etc., 
from south to north, as shown in Figure I. 

Twenty-four bushes of each variety were 
randomized into 4 groups of 6 bushes each, each 
group being treated by one of the four wintering 
methods# Extra bushes were also randomized among 
these in the plots and they were left for replace- :i 
ment of plants which sucoumbed the first season, 
before any wintering method had been tested# 

Hence, there was a complete stand for each of the 
four wintering methods# 

The leaves of half of the plants of each 
treatment were removed before the bushes were 
placed in winter quarters# Data are recorded 
separately for the defoliated and not-defoliated 
bushes# 

The bushes of each variety were numbered from 
the south-east corner, from west to east, (numbers

1 to 6) , and then again from west to east in the 
next row north, (numbers 7 to 12), and so forth 
up to number 30, the total for any one variety. 
The next variety was numbered in the same manner 
from west to east and south to north. This was 
continued for each of the 8 varieties. 

The various wintering methods were as 
follows; 

1. Wintered outdoors, bushes mounded with 1 foot 
of soil and mulched with several inches of 
straw. 

2. Wintered in the cellar. The plants were 
heeled in a box of earth, and the box was 
plaoed in a cool, moderately dry cellar, in 
which the temperature never went below 
freezing. 

3. Wintered outdoors in a trench about 2 feet 
deep, the earth being replaced over the 
bundles of plants plaoed horizontally in 
the bottom. 

4. Wintered outdoors in a pit about 4 feet deep,

the bundles of bushes placed horizontally, the 
pit filled with straw, and a roof of lumber 
erected over the top to keep out moisture. 

Bush number 1 of all varieties was con¬ 
sistently given one of the four treatments; a 
similar plan was followed for the other bush 
numbers, according to Table I. If a bush died, 
one of the extra bushes was used in its place# 
Aside from this, the treatment was identical for 
every number of each variety# 

The standard treatment given every bush of 
all varieties is shown in Table II. 

1939 Varietal-wintering test .- This series con¬ 
sisted of 300 bushes planted on the west side of 
the south section of the test area, comprising the 
west 6 rows exclusive of 7 plants in each of these 
rows at the north end of the plot flanking on the 
foot-path. There are, in this part of the test, 

36 bushes of each of the following varieties; (I) 
Avoca, (J) British Queen, (K) Felbergts Rosa 
Druschki, (L) Joanna Hill, (M) Mme. Jules Bouche,

(P) Sunburst# These varieties are planted from 
south to north in the plot in the order mentioned, 
there being 6 bushes in each of the 6 rows. This 
is a near duplication of the 1938 test. 

The bushes of each plot were randomized in 
the same manner as for the 1938 test previously 
mentioned, and were again numbered from the south¬ 
west corner from west to east, and from south to 
north. This numbering system is uniform through¬ 
out the whole test. 

The various wintering methods were the 
same as in the 1938 test, except for the addition 
of a fifth treatment which involved completely 
waxing the bush in autumn. The leaves were all 
removed from the plants and then wax was applied 
with a brush from a wax melter which kept it 
in a liquid condition. 

A standard treatment for each numbered 
bush of each variety was arranged by randomization, 
as in the 1938 test, and was as shown in Table 
III.

1939 Fertilizer-wintering test *- The east 3 rows 
of the south section of the plot, exclusive of 
the north 3 plants in each of the 3 rows flanking 
the path constitute the 1939 fertilizer-wintering 
test. The variety Sunburst was used. The area is 
subdivided into 10 plots of 23 bushes each, allow¬ 
ing for a square plot with 3 bushes along each side. 
These 23 -bush plots are lettered from the south end, 
letters Q to Z inclusive, and the plants in each 
plot are numbered as in the other test, from the 
south-west oorner, from west to east and from 
south to north* The 23 bushes in each plot are 
utilized as follows, 16 fertilizer treatments, 6 
checks, and 3 bushes for replacement. Each of the 
10 plots, the 23 bushes in each being numbered 
identically, has corresponding bushes treated the 
same way, the net result being that every fer¬ 
tilizer treatment is replicated in each of the 
10 plots. The treatment given has been as 
follows. 

Six checks, (watered as are the other treat¬ 
ments but no chemical). 

No treatment early; late application of 















-44- 


oyanamide (3 oz. per bush) from August 1 $ 
to September 15 inclusive (every 2 weeks). 

Sodium nitrate early (4 oz. per bush on May 
15 and June 1) followed by 2;10:10 mixture 
(3 oz. per bush) to mid-July* 


Manure at 20 tons per acre at planting time 
(8£ pounds per bush). 

Manure (liquid, 1 qt. per bush) till July 15. 

Manure (liquid, 1 qt. per bush) till August 15. 

Manure (liquid, 1 qt. per bush) till September 13. 


Bonemeal mixed with soil at planting time at 
rate of 6 oz. per bush. 


Bonemeal plus wood ashes, (unleached), at

1^40 Fertilizer-wintering test .- Most of this 
section of the test is planted in the area east 
of the 1938 varietal wintering test, comprising 
the 5 rows on the east side of the north section 
of the plot. Forty bushes in each of the 5 rows 
allowed space for 8 plots of 25 bushes each. The 
other two plots of 25 bushes each were located 
south of the path, involving the 5 north plants 
of each of the 10 east rows of the south section 
of the test area. The 5 plants in each of the 5 
west rows of the 10 previously mentioned con¬ 
stitute plot A, and those in the other 5 rows 
constitute plot B. Plot C comprises the 5 south 
bushes of each of the 5 rows in the main plot, 
and the other plots continue on from south to 
north, up to J. 

Fertilizer applications were made twice a 
month and the treatments are the same as in the 
1939 fertilizer-wintering test, with two ex¬ 
ceptions. These are; 

(a) The late application of cyanamide. In 













-46- 


the 1939 test, application was at the rate of 3 
ounoes per bush, but in the 1940 test the cyanamide 
was applied at half the rate, namely, lj ounoes 
per bush. 

(b) Sodium nitrate early and 2;10;10 later. 
In the 1939 test, the rates of application were 
4 ounoes and 3 ounces each, respectively, but in 
the 1940 test the rates were halved being applied 
at 2 and 1-J- ounces each, respectively. 

The treatments are as follows. 

Six checks, (watered as are the other treat¬ 
ments but no chemical). 

No treatment early, late application of cyana¬ 
mide (14 oz. per bush) from August 13 to 
September 13 inclusive. (Every two weeks). 

Sodium nitrate early (2 oz. per bush on May 13 
and June 1) followed by 2;10;10 mixture (l£

MEASURE OF SUCCESS OF WINTERING- METHOD 

It was decided after a review of the liter¬ 
ature that the best measure of the success of the 
wintering method would be the vigour of the bush 
as indicated by the amount of top growth, and the 
number of blooms produced. Consequently, the 
amount of growth was measured (a) at intervals 
throughout each growing season, and (b) just before 
storage for winter. Furthermore, the number of 











-48- 


blooms was counted every week or ten days through¬ 
out the main blooming season, and once the number 
was reoorded, the blooms were removed from the 
bushes# To make the test uniform, an attempt was 
made to remove the blooms after they had wilted, 
or just a day or so before they would wilt, or 
soon after they had dropped their petals, so that 
there would not be a drain on the plants by seed 
production or an unfair advantage due to too early 
removal. 

Counts were made of the number of blooms 
and buds on the plant as well as of the number of 
blooms removed. This provided some indication for 
the next set of notes as to the number of blooms 
that could be expected to be at the stage of re¬ 
moval, thus providing a check as to whether some 
had been missed. Furthermore, it helped to prevent 
mistakes of recording data for the wrong bush, and 
facilitated the correction of any such error. 

A small point arose during the note taking, 
namely: when does a bud become a bloom? The 
measure used as a guide in this respect was the 
condition of the five sepals which clasp the 











-49- 


oorolla. When three of the five had loosened 
from the petals, the bud was called a bloom. If 
only two were free or none were free, it was still 
a bud. 


The following communication dated August 
15, 1940, from Dr. R. C. Allen of Cornell University, 
an authority on roses, was received two years after 
the plan for this project was decided upon, and it 
supports the procedure followed in the taking of 
records: 


"One year we took a great deal of 
data on all different parts of the plant. 

We counted the number of buds, the number 
of flowers, the number of buds which broke 
on the stem, the number of leaves produced 
during different parts of the season, the 
number of strong basal shoots, the diameter 
of the twigs, and the basal shoots. How¬ 
ever, when we were all through, we found 
that number of blooms and total vegetative 
growth, or rather total elongation of all 
the shoots gave us numerical values which 
seemed to us to most closely correlate 
with visible observation.”

RSSULTS 

1938 Rose varietal-wintering test .- Results of 
this part of the test involved the four wintering 
methods, namely: 

1. Wintered outdoors, bushes mounded with 1 foot 
of soil and mulched with several inches of 
straw* 

2* Wintered in the cellar* The plants were heeled 
in a box of earth, and the box was placed in a 
cool, moderately dry cellar, in which the 
temperature never went below freezing. 

3* Wintered outdoors in a trench about 2 feet 
deep, the earth being placed over the plants 
after they were laid in a horizontal position 
in the bottom* 

4. Wintered outdoors in a pit about 4 feet deep, 
bushes laid in a horizontal position, the pit 
filled with straw, and a roof of lumber 
erected over the top to keep out moisture* 

In further discussion, the above treatments 
are referred to as, 1* wintered outside, 2. win- 


















' • 








? 









-51- 


tered in collar, 3* wintered in trench, and 4. 
wintered in pit. 

Bush number 1 of all varieties was con¬ 
sistently given one of the four treatments, 
similarly for the other bush numbers, according 
to Table I. If a bush died, one of the extra 
bushes was used in its place* Aside from this, 
the treatment was identical for every number of 
each variety. 

Best results were obtained from wintering 
in the pit (Table IV)* After wintering two years, 
the pit method gave nearly double the growth and 
number of blooms as its closest rival. 

Considering both blooms and growth, the 
outside method gave one more inch of growth, where¬ 
as the trench method gave one more bloom. This 
conclusion is based on average figures for bushes 
that were defoliated and those that were not. It 
is of interest to note that the results after 
wintering one season were not quite the same. In 
1939, the best wintering as indicated by number 
of bloom and growth was given by the trench method. 



























-52- 


However, the pit method was a close second followed 
by the outside treatment. 

Defoliation is apparently not a significant 
factor. Better results were obtained from non- 
defoliated bushes, which was quite contrary to 
expected results. The difference was not very 
great, however. 

Data are given for 1958, the year the bushes 
were planted, and growth as well as bloom results 
for the various randomized treatments, indicate 
that bushes of very uniform vigour were selected 
for each treatment. 

When the amount of labour involved with 
these different wintering treatments is considered, 
it is found that the cellar method, probably in¬ 
volving the least labour, has given the poorest 
results, and beyond that, there is little to choose 
between the other three methods. 

An idea of the vigour of the bushes of this 
1958 planting in 1959 , after wintered once, compared 
to 1958 before wintering, may be observed (Figures 
II and III).

1939 Rose varietal-winterjpg test .- Results of 
this particular test involved, besides the four 
wintering methods in the 1938 test, another, namely, 
waxing the branches of the bushes completely with 
Parawax. The wax was brushed on by hand, a rather 
laborious procedure# Only about a half dozen 
bushes could be treated per hour, and about £ pound 
of wax was used for that number. This made a more 
expensive treatment than any of the others in the 
test, but the system was a great success in pro¬ 
moting successful wintering. Despite the fact 
that these waxing results are only representative 
of one winter, they are still quite significant# 

The outside wintering gave second best results and 
the trench and pit methods were about the same 
(Table V). The cellar wintering system again was 
definitely inferior. This practically eliminates 
the cellar wintering method as a system to be 
recommended for general use. 

Results to date for this varietal-wintering 
test give no conclusive result on the basis of 
which a recommendation could be made for general 


use#

Results of defoliating versus not de¬ 
foliating showed a trend in favour of the latter. 
Since defoliation requires considerable work, and 
since the results show a harmful response, the 
practice should be discouraged. Further emphasis 
on this point appears in the results for the 1938 
test which, after having run for two winters, showed 
no advantage for defoliating. 

1939 Fertilizer-wintering test .- Treatment was made 
with some 16 different fertilizer combinations. 
Tables VI and VII show results for 1939 and 1940, 
respectively# 

In Table VII it will be noted that the three 
liquid-manure treatments gave the best results. In 
particular, the treatment with liquid manure in 
which the application was continued to September 
15 , commands attention. 

Another feature of the liquid-manure treat¬ 
ment to September 15, (Table VI), is that, in the 
initial year of application, more blooms were 
produced than by any other fertilizer used, in¬ 
cluding, of course, the checks. 










59- 


On© might expect that late application of 
liquid-manure which is rich in nitrogen would oause 
late growth which would not winter well* Perhaps the 
water in the liquid-manure may have had some effect 
in making the fertilizer nutrients available, but 
there is no definite information on this point# One 
definite conclusion, however, may be drawn from the 
test, namely, that liquid-manure is a good fertilizer 
for rose bushes. 

The only other treatment that gave results 
superior to the average of the 6 checks, was a 
phosphorus-potash application, 0:10;8 applied to 
September 15# 

One treatment with bonemeal, as well as one 
with bonemeal plus wood ashes (both applications 
made at planting time), are part of this test# 

Survey of the results for these two treatments 
indicates that the addition of wood ashes had a 
definitely harmful effect# 

The cyanamide and sodium nitrate treatments 
at the rate of application used, were definitely of 
no value.

A comparison of the three applications of 
4;10;8 to the middle of July, August and September, 
respectively, showed that inconsistent results were 
obtained. Definitely the best of these three is 
the application continued to the middle of July. 

The others give considerably poorer growth and 
bloom, but the application to mid-September is 
slightly superior to those continued to mid-August. 
1940 Fertilizer-wintering test .- Results for growth 
and bloom for this 1940 section of the test, in 
the year of planting, are given, not to show 
wintering possibilities, but more as an indication 
of response to fertilizer during the initial year. 

As was the case with the 1939 fertilizer 
test, the results obtained the first year favoured 
the liquid-manure treatments. Fortnightly ap¬ 
plications to mid-July gave best results, followed 
in order by applications to mid-August and mid- 
September. 

The cyanamide and sodium nitrate treatments 
which were definitely unsatisfactory in the 1939 
test, are evidently better in the new test conducted

in 1940, (although these plants have not yet 
wintered), apparently due to the fact that the 
rate of application was halved. 

In the 1939 tests bonemeal alone gave 
better results than when it was supplemented by 
unleached wood ashes. 

Applications of 4;10:8 to mid-July, August, 
and September show best results for application 
to mid-July, and the next best by discontinuation 
on August 19 . 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO THE DATA 

The data of the two varietal wintering 
tests were examined with a view to the application 
of some form of statistical analysis. It appeared 
at first that analysis of variance could be applied, 
but further study indicated this to be impracticable. 
The fact that the test was not completely randomized 
would necessitate qualification of any statement 
made. Sven if the test had been completely ran¬ 
domized, the occurrence of an excess of zeros in 
the results for some treatments would have rendered 
the variance table inaccurate. Furthermore, the 













-65- 


results are clearly evident without statistical 
analysis. 

Therefore, in spite of the fact that some 
analysis was done, it was not recorded. 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The results from three years’ experiments 
with roses grown at Beaverlodge, in an attempt to 
determine the most satisfactory method of winter¬ 
ing in a northern climate are presented. The 
main conclusions reached are as follows: 

1. Liquid manure has been found to be a good 
fertilizer for roses from the standpoint of; 

(a) promoting satisfactory wintering, and 

(b) inducing strong growth and heavy bloom 
production, even in the year of planting 
before wintering. Applications beginning 
mid-May, and continued fortnightly to mid- 
July have been best. 

2. Liquid manure is the only fertilizer that 
has consistently contributed to satisfactory 
wintering, or even to greater bloom pro- 














- 66 - 


duct Ion* There is some question as to 
whether the water of the liquid manure may 
not have been of some significance along 
with the fertilizer elements contained there¬ 
in. 

3* Waxing rose plants for winter protection has 
given promising results from the standpoint 
of protection from winter killing. With this 
fact established, the next step is to find 
a cheaper and less laborious method of apply¬ 
ing the wax for the treatment to be practicable. 

4. The work with waxed and unwaxed rose canes 
indicates the killing may be attributed to a 
process of drying to death. Since the exper¬ 
iments were planned on the assumption that 
killing was due to freezing to death, further 
research based on this theory of killing due 
to drying, should be fruitful of some 
practical protective measure. 

3 . The best method for wintering yet found and 
proven by more than one year*s results, has 



















-67- 


been that of digging up the roses in 
autumn, and, after tying them in bundles, 
laying the bundles in the bottom of a pit 
some four feet deep, then filling in with 
straw, and finally erecting a roof over the 
pit.
