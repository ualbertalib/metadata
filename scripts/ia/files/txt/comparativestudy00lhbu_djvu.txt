CHAPTER 1-NATURE OF THE TESTS. 

In 1867 the Fathers of Confederation decided that 
education in Canada should be of provincial rather than of 
federal concern. Since that time the relative efficiency 
of the various provincial systems of education has been 
debated many times, often with more heat than light. The 
lack of a suitable standard of measuring achievement has 
permitted each person to hold his opinions without danger 
of having them challenged by scientific investigation. 

This situation may soon be at an end. 

During the autumn of 1943 the Research Committee of 
the-Canadian Teachers’ Federation obtained from the Cana¬ 
dian Council for Educational Research a grant-in-aid to 
finance a study of relative attainments of matriculation 
students in the various provinces of Canada. 

The following procedures were agreed upon: the 
comparative standings of students should be obtained in 
English and Social Studies; a representative group of 
schools should be selected in each province; final test 
items should be uniform for all schools; the items should 
adequately test a wide range of learnings in the subject; 
certain items would be rather familiar to the students of 
a given province, other items would be rather unfamiliar; 
no gross provincial averages should be published for any

test; results should be in terms of relative provincial 
success on various types of test items. It was hoped that 
this treatment would provide a basis by which the 
strengths and weaknesses of each provincial program could 
be appraised. 

All the provinces except Ontario co-operated in the 
survey? Liaison officers in the Departments of Educ ation 
and provincial committees of teachers were appointed to 
assist in the survey. The following were selected: 

British Columbia; Major H. B. King, Mr. L. B. Stibbs. 
Alberta; Dr. H. C. Newland, Dr. C. Sansom. 

Saskatchewan; Mr. R. J. Davidson, Mr. J. C. Bates. 

Manitoba; Mr. Rathwell, Miss Robena Whiteside. 

Quebec Protestant; Mr. E. C. Woodley, Mr. Robert Japp. 
Quebec Catholic; Mr. B. 0. Filteau, Rev. G-. E. Carter. 

Nova Scotia; Mr. H. P. Moffat, Mr. Gerald Tingley. 

New Brunswick; Mr. K. H. Brewer, Mr. L. F. Hashey. 

Prince Edward Island; Mr. A. S. Woollier. 

During the winter of 1943-44, two composite tests were 
compiled from the test items that, 'each committee had sub¬ 
mitted. In April they were sent out to those city, town 
and village schools vdiich had been selected by the Depart- 

*Nova Scotia assisted up to the point where the tests were 
given in the class room.

Comprehension, Map Knowledge. 

The Committee was anxious to discover the students* 
ability to read and interpret English, to find what 
significant facts of history dnd.geography are known, to 
determine how these facts have influenced their thinking, 
and to discover what attitudes have been developed re¬ 
specting' social problems.

"The main feature of the Plan for Social Security is 
a scheme of social insurance against interruption and de¬ 
struction. of earning power and for special expenditure 
arising at birth, marriage or death. The scheme embodies 
six fundamental principles: flat rate of subsistence 
benefit; flat rate of contribution; unification of ad¬ 
ministrative responsibility; adequacy of benefit; com¬ 
prehensiveness and classification. These principles are * 
explained in paras. 303-309. Based on them and in com¬ 
bination with national assistance and voluntary inairanee 
as subsidiary methods, the aim of the Plan for Social 
Security is to make want under any circumstances 
unnecessary,” Sir. Wm. Beveridge.

Assuming that a comparison of the provincial means 
will give a fair estimate of provincial achievement, the 
provinces in order of merit are: 

Sheet ! A*: Province B, A, D, C, F, G, and E. 

Sheet T B ! : Province D, A, F, C, B, G and E. 

In order to determine whether the differences between 
the means were significant, the following procedure was 


used 









s 





















26 


The standard error of the difference between two un¬ 
correlated means was obtained from the formula:^ 




-h V 


wheref^and f*£are the standard 
errors of the means of the 
successive groups. 


This result was then divided into the actual difference 
between the means of the successive provinces when they 
were arranged in order of merit. If the result is 3 or 
greater, the difference between the means is regarded as 
significant.

Thus one cannot be certain that the provinces have 
been arranged in the correct order. In Sheet n A !t the 
difference became significant when Provinces A and C (the 
first and fourth were compared). In Sheet T? B TI the first 
and the third showed a significant difference.

The sections of two papers were arranged under five 
headings. Sections 2 and 4 of Sheet n A n and Section 9 of 
! Sheet !, B ,! were grouped under Current Events; Sections 1, 

3 and 5 of Sheet n A T! and Section 10 of Sheet fl B n were 
placed under Historical Facts; Sections 12 and 14 of 
Sheet IT B !I were grouped under Vocabulary; Sections 6 and 
7 of Sheet **A n and Sections 13 and 15 of Sheet ,T B TT were 
placed under Heading Comprehension; Sections 11 and 16 
| of Sheet !! B TT were grouped under Geography. The provinces 
were then arranged according to their average marks for 
the topic.

It would appear that the schools in Provinces C and 
D vary least in Social Studies achievement; those of 
Provinces A, G, and F show an average variation, while 
those of Provinces E and B show a greater variation. The 
relative rigidity of the various programmes of studies may 
account for this lack of uniformity. 
o, PROVINCIAL DIFFERENCES AUCUKDIBG TU TOi-ICS. 

The Dominion mean for each of the topics was obtained. 
The average deviation of each of the provinces from this 
mean was calculated. This deviation was expressed as a

It would appear that the provinces differ from one

Historical Pacts and Current Events, and least in Geo¬ 
graphy. One is struck by the close'relationship between 
the percentage deviations in Vocabulary and Comprehension.

It would be hazardous to reason from the above 
figures that Canadian students are relatively Y/eak in 
some fields of Social Studies and comparatively strong 
in others. Both sections 2 and 10 deal with Current 
Events, yet there is a variation of 25$ in the results 
of the two sections. The relative difficulty of the 
various questions making up a section is a very important 
factor in determining the mark obtained.

CHAPTER 4 


CONCLUSIONS. 


- 35 - 


The Canadian teachers 1 Federation Research Committee 
was anxious to find what significant facts of history and 
geography.are known by the average Canadian student of 
Grade XI, to determine how these facts have influenced 
the thinking of this average student, and to discover 
what attitudes respecting social problems have been 
developed. 

It would appear that in Social Studies achievement, 
the provinces in order of merit are: D, A, B, C, F, G-, 
and E. It cannot be assumed that this order would not be 
changed if a much larger sampling were' taken, as the 
differences between the means of successive provinces v/ere 
not significant in three cases. 

When the various items v\rere gathered together under 
the five classifications according to topics. Provinces 
D, A, and B again showed their superiority. This is 
especially true in Vocabulary Comprehension and Reading 
Comprehension. These are considered to be two of the 
most valuable abilities developed by good Social Studies 
procedure.

certain that the difference did not arise because of 
errors in sampling# There is no psychological explanation 
for this slight superiority as other studies show that 
the central tendencies of intelligence scores made by boys 
and girls appear to coincide.^ 

The comparison of the three types of schools, city, 
town and village gave the following results: 

1. The obtained difference between town and city was 
not significant (the ratio was .66). 

2. The obtained difference betwreen city and village was 
not significant (the ratio was .6). 

3. The obtained difference between town and village was 
not significant (the ratio was 1.1). 

It would appear that town students rank first, city 

students, second, and village students, third. 

When the question of the degree to which the schools 

of the various provinces differed from the means of the 

respective provinces was investigated, it was found that ■ 

the schools of Provinces C and D showed a relatively low 

degree of deviation from the average of the province. 

The schools of Provinces B and E went to the other extreme. 

The explanation may be that the programmes of studies in 

Provinces C and D are relatively rigid, while those of

Co., London, 1937, p. 165.

Provinces B and E permit more flexibility in Social 
Studies. 

In those questions involving attitudes on questions 
of to-day, the students varied very little from province 
to province in their answers to most of the questions. 

The greatest variation of opinion was shown in the 
questions dealing with strikes and picketing, taxation on 
large incomes, European immigration into Canada, voting 
ages, airfields to safeguard Canada against Russia, the 
planning and co-ordination of production. It would be 
interesting to know what factors, educational, social, 
economic, racial, caused these deviations from the average 
The uniformity shown in most of the answers can be ex¬ 
plained by the nation-wide coverage of both the Canadian 
Broadcasting Corporation and the various new-agencies 
supplying information to our daily newspapers. The 
question, as to whether uniformity or diversity of opinion 
on.these matters is desirable, is a matter of opinion. 

The percentage results for the various sections 
ranged from 42 fo on the Canadian History Section to 75 fo on 
Section 9, which involved reasoning. One must be cautious 
in assuming that Canadian History is being badly taught. 
The writer is of the opinion that, of the nine questions 
of this section, three of them are not a true measure of a

general knowledge of Canadian History. These questions 
are: "Who was the first bishop of Quebec?", "In What 

year was the Hudson’s Bay Company founded?", and "What 
Canadian explorer was the first to reach the present site 
of Winnipeg?"* The pupils made marks of 24$, 19$, and 
30$ on these three‘questions. If the marks for these 
three questions were disregarded, the mark for the section 
would be 51$. This mark is slightly below that of the 
average percentage mark for the 128 items of the two tests, 
which was 53$. 

This low mark of 53$, which will be disappointing to 
many, raises the question of the validity of the entire 
test* The writer will attempt to answer' some of the ob¬ 
jections which may arise. 

1. Was the test given to schools which might be con¬ 
sidered representative of the schools of that province? 

The Committee arranged so that the pupils of city, town, 
and village schools v/ould be tested. However, just four 
schools in one province, and five in another were tested. 
One wonders if these results give a true picture of the 
Social Studies achievement of those two provinces. 

2. Were the questions of such a nature that they 
tested those abilities that could reasonably be expected 
of a Grade XI student? The write is of the opinion that,

except for the three questions on Canadian History, and 
perhaps two or three others, the questions did provide a 
fair test. They tested abilities in the fields of 
Current Events, Historical Facts, Vocabulary, Compre¬ 
hension, and Geography. Section 15, which tested the 
student's’ ability to understand the Beveridge Report, 
required the student to make very fine distinctions. 

3. Can an objective type test measure Social Studies 
achievement as well as can the conventional essay type 
questions. This will be answered by quoting from "An 
Investigation of the Relative Validity of Objective and 
Essay Type Tests in History." 

"An objective type test measures both informational 
and developmental skills as well as does an essay type 
test." 

"An objective test covers as much subject matter as 
does an essay test." 

"An objective test lends itself to a better dis-. 
tribution over the subject matter than does an essay test." 

"An objective test measures with greater accuracy 
than does.an essay test." 

"An objective test does not assess a candidate’s 
ability to express ideas in acceptable language."

"An objective test does not measure as well as an 
essay type test could, a pupil's ability to organize 
material about a given topic."* 

4. Can such a survey measure achievement in Social 
Studies? In.the social sciences, perhaps more than in, 
any other subject taught in the high schools, results of 
classroom instruction and experiences cannot be evaluated 
by such immediate reactions as may be revealed by any form 
of testing. Qualities, abilities, attitudes, and interests 
can only be judged in the future life of the student. 

Tests do not predict probably future conduct or the app¬ 
lication of present skills 'and interests, even in the 
immediate life outside of school. 

Many teachers see facts merely a means to an end, a 
vehicle for promoting interest, for practice in the study 
skills, for understanding of relationships and duties, for 
inspiring attitudes.** 

However the most progressive-minded teacher should 
admit that there are certain significant facts, the re¬ 
tention of which is necessary for an accurate knowledge 
of, and an informed insight into, man and society. The

Committee wished, to discover to what degree these facts 
are retained. 

In this survey the Canadian Teachers 1 Federation has 
obtained much data which should result in constructive 
criticism.' Methods and curricula, which have resulted in 
comparatively high achievement, should be studied with 
the purpose of adopting them in those provinces where the 
achievement has been lower. If this is done, then the 
Canadian high school students of to-morrow will benefit 
from this investigation of Social Studies achievement 
of Canadian Grade XI students.
