IMKODUCTION 


Oil seeds constitute an Important crop in many areas wherever 
agriculture is practiced• The varied industrial requirements for 
products derived from fats and oils have provided a continuous stimulus 
for agricultural research in these crops. 

Oleaginous materials derived from oil seeds form the basis of 
a wide variety of finished products such as shortening^ salad oil, soaps, 
paints, varnishes, printing ink, oil cloth, linoleum and lubricants. 

Broadly speaking, it may be stated that the predominancy of old 
sources of fats and oils, namely, dairy cows, meat cattle and hogs, are 
on the economic defensive, and that the new sources derived from plants 
are on the increase. In Canada the main oil crop plants are sunflowers, 
soya beans, rape and fleix. While progress has been made in developing 
varieties of sunflowers suited to oil seed production lander Canadian 
conditions, there is a pressing need for an intensified breeding program 
in which particular emphasis is placed on such features as greater seed 
yield, higher oil content, better oil quality, earliness in matiarity and 
suitability for machine harvesting. 

Since vegetable oils are as yet produced on a relatively small 
scale from a few crops, it would appear that expansion in their production 
and use will depend in considerable measure on research in plant breeding 
technology and chemistry. By virtue of its long photoperiod the sunflower 
is the most suitable oil seed crop in northern regions. 

One of the most important aspects in sunflower breeding is the

production and utilization of single cross hybrids as a means of obtaining 
better yields. 

Although basically similar to the utilization of heterosis in 
hybrid corn, the technique of inbreeding and crossing in sunflowers is 
quite different, because of differences in their floral structure and 
mode of pollination. The task of hybridization is made more difficult 
because both male and female elements occur in the same flower. Older 
natural conditions pollination is affected by Insects, mainly bees. 

In artificial crossing, to produce hybrid seed, hand pollination 
is most common. Providing the flowering of lines used in a natural cross 
occiars simxiltaneously, the percentage of crossed seeds is undoubtedly 
affected by the degree of self-fertility of the female parent, and the 
amount of viable pollen produced by the male parent. 

The purpose of the present project was to study pollen produc¬ 
tion in sunflower lines as a criterion for choosing parental material 
for the production of hybrid seed.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Despite the extensive research on the various phases of sun¬ 
flower breeding, critical data relative to the production of pollen in 
different sunflower lines, in relation to a hybridization program, are 
rather meager* 

Several investigators have reported that pollen production and 
pollen fertility are of importance in sunflower hybridization. Reiser (7) 
reported on testing pollen fertility by smearing anthers in lectaphenol 
and cotton blue. The grains which took a dark blue stain were counted as 
good. Ikirau (20) stressed that the percentage of crossed sunflower seed 
produced by any line, when flowering occurs simultaneously, is undoubtedly 
affected primarily by the degree of self-fertility of the female parent 
and/or the amount of good pollen produced by the other line. 

Platchek (14) showed that there is a range of self-fertility 
which extends from con^letely sterile to highly fertile plants. This 
author stressed also the point that the amount of pollen produced by the 
different varieties should not be overlooked in the determination and 
choice of the parents. He also stated that plants with white (colorless) 
pollen gave extremely well-developed heads* 

Rudorf (16) in his breeding program succeeded in producing 
sunflower strains which showed sufficiently early ripening to be success¬ 
fully grown in the rainy northwestern part of Germany. The heads can be 
used as a source of pretein and protein fodder, while the stems yield 
(X- cellulose which is used for making paper sind textiles.

Sharoyko (17) showed that the ash in the stalks and heads 
contained 4% Phosphorus and 35.3% Potassium. This hi^ potassium content 
suggests that the sunflower pleuits can be utilized as fertilizer. 

Marchenko (12) sees a new future for a cheap source of fructose 
production, from hybrids between Helianthus annuus x Helianthus tiiber- 
osis. One hectar (2.5 acres) produced 76 tons of green stalks which 
contain 15% fructose under the conditions of this test. 

Lutikov (11) studied pollen production from the standpoint of 
insect pollination. He recommends a ratio of 1 - 1.5 bee hives per 
hectar of seeded sunflowers. Additional pollination by hand ^eatly 
increased the setting of seed. 

Morozov (13) demonstrated that sunflower pollen loses its 
viability in the sunlight. It has its hipest viability at a relative 
humidity of 100%. 

Many other valuable papers dealing with the production and 
breeding of sunflowers have been published. In Canada a great amount of 
work was done by Putt (15), Putt and Oferau, Itoau and White (20) and 
others. Space does not permit detailed discussion of these papers; 
however, because of the increasing economical is^jortance of this oil 
crop, a number of additional references are given in the Appendix. 

These achievements at home and abroad indicate the ia^ortant 
part that plant breeding experiments play toward making sunflowers a 
major oil crop of the fxrture.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 


This report deals with two separate experiments. The first 
experiment utilized selfed progenies from lines introduced at the 
University of Alberta in 1947; (see frequency tables of lines used in 
1951 and 1952). In the second experiment, the two standard lines which 
are used in the production of the hybrid "Advance" were subjected to a 
new hybridization trial. 

A - Experiment 1. 

1* Analysis of Pollen Production ; Sunflower Lines used in the 
Project 1951 - 1952. 

In 1951, due to poor germination as a resialt of a very wet 
fall and early frost, most of the breeding material was lost. Therefore, 
the pollen production studies in 1952 were continued on material substi¬ 
tuted as being sijailar to material used in 1961, and on German and 
Jugoslav introductions not previously used. In both years the study of 
pollen production in the different lines was based on random saH 5 >les of 
5 florets collected from each of 5 random heads selected from each line 
and subline. 

2. Method of Sampling, and Developing a Microscopic Technique 

for Pollen Analysis* 

An attempt was made to \ 2 se the same niamber of plants in 
each line in order to ensure adequate sampling, ^enever some variation 
in stand occurred, the material was collected from the greatest number of

available plants. To avoid pollen loss, florets were collected Just 
prior to protrusion of stigmas from the fully extended anthers. 

The florets were grasped with forceps, gently separated from 
the ovary, collected in vials and stored at a teurperature of 35®F. Those 
lines which had not begun to bloom by the first frost were disregarded. 

Since sunflower pollen has the tendency to stick together in 
clumps, it was necessary to find a reagent in which the pollen grains 
could be uniformly dispersed. The following reagents were tested: 

1. Water + Dreft 0.1 - 0*5% by wt. 

2. Carbowax 0.1-1% solution, prepared by melting Carbowax 

and adding water. 

3. Petroleum oil fractions. 

4. Water + Vatsol K 0,1 - 0.5% by wt. 

5. Normal Calberla®s Solution. 

6. Medi-Calgon (Sodium Hexametaphosphate). 

The most favorable reagent was Medi-Calgon. The normal procedure for 
preparing the pollen material for microscopic examination was to crush 
and wash the five florets in a l/4 ml. of saturated solution of Medi- 
Calgon. A microscopic slide bearing three drops of this liquid, 
containing the dispersed pollen, was prepared and examined under low power 
magnification. Five horizontal and five vertical readings were made on 
each slide. A total of ten readings was thus made for each plant. The 
coxmts of the ten readings for each individual plant were summated and 
divided by ten, giving the average pollen grain production per plant. 

Thtis the total of all readings in one line or subline gave an avereige for

that specific line or subline. 

In order to present this great amount of material in a summar¬ 
ized form, it was necessary to make frequency tables for the 1951 and 
1952 analyses and the standard error of the mean ) calculated, (see 

page 10). 

B - Experiment 2. 

In the first part of this experiment, varying proportions of the 
two inbred lines , S - 37 « 388 (female parent) and Sunrise (male parent) 
were grown in separate rows in 1951, in the following continuations: 

(a) 2 rows of each - gdternating. 

(b) 4 rows of S - 37 - 388, 2 rows of Sunrise. 

(c) 6 rows of S - 37 - 388, 2 rows of Sunrise. 

The seed was harvested separately from the two inbred lines, and a yield 
trial from the 1951 material conducted in 1952. Each plot was 20 feet 
long and consisted of 24 « 27 rows.

These plots were sown in three 40-foot rows and isolated from each other 
by at least l/4 of a mile* 

In all tests, the seeds were sown about 2 inches deep in rows 
3 feet apart with a V-belt hand-seeder* 

The plants were considered to be mature when the backs of the 
heads were yellow and the involucral bracts were brown* Because of the 
wet weather, the plants were left in the fields until after* frost* 
When thoroughly dry, the heads were threshed and the seed cleaned* 

In the spring of 1952 a yield trial was set up, from seed 
obtained in the different mixtures of the parental lines. Due to heavy 
seed losses as the result of extremely unfavorable weather, the yield 
trial was limited to three randomnized single rod « row plots, with a 
36-inch spacing. 

Due to the above-mentioned unfavorable conditions, germination 
was extremely poor. Since the unfavorable clijoatic conditions prevented 
drying and threshing of this material, the amount of hybridization from 
the different combinations of the two parent lines had to be estimated 
by visual selection. Hybrids were distinguished from seifs mainly on 
the following visually observable characteristics: 

(a) Size and vigoiar of plant* 

(b) Head and plant type. 

(c) Seed coat color and shape.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


A - E:q)eriment 1. 

1. Pollen Production of Inbred Lines of Sunflowers, 

In order to illustrate the method of evaluating the pollen 
producing capacities of the lines, examples of the microscopic counts of 
pollen grains are given in Table !• 

The data on comparative pollen production in the different 
lines are shown in the frequency distribution given in Tables II, III and 
IV, Results obtained in 1951 were divided into two sections: first, 
varieties with more than one mean reading (Table II « Each datum is the 
mean of several means, each of the latter being the mean of 10 slide 
readings each from 5 plants of a line), and second, varieties having only 
one mean, the data being on a single plant basis (Table III, 1951 data; 
Table IV, 1952 data; » Each datum is the mean of 10 readings from a 
single plant). Considered in the light of their standard errors, it is 
clear that certain lines can be considered as favorable, and certain 
others as unfavorable material for individual plant selection toward 
heavier pollen production. 

2, Analysis of Data. 

The analysis of variance for 1951 was made on three kinds 

of data: 

1# With aH means included. 

2. With more than one mean. 

3, With means on single plant basis.

The highly significant F value indicates a significant differ¬ 
ence in poLLen production between the different varieties. The Least 
Significant Difference (L.S.D.) was confuted in order to compare the 
means of varieties generally to those of the two standard lines, 

S - 37 - 388 and Sunrise. The value obtained was

In order to avoid any error due to the inclusion of some 
lines having only one mean in the analysis of Table V, the analysis was 
repeated on the data of Table II and Table III separately. The test of 
homogeneity was applied to the variances of the two analyses. The 
following results were obtained:

female parent in a hybridization program for high or low pollen production, 

3* Correlation of Pollen Production in 1951 and in 1952 by 

Genetically Similar Material, 

As a further step, a correlation coefficient was computed 
for the bivariate data arising from pollen counts made in 1951 and 1952 on 
genetically similar lines, with the object of determining the degree of 
interdependence or co-variation in pollen production over the two years, 

A value of r * 0.729** was obtained. To check this highly 
significant correlation coefficient, a t test for paired data for both 
years was applied, which confirmed the resialt obtained above - 

t = 3.715** 

The high significance of the r and t tests shows that the 
constancy in pollen pruduction is due to genetically pure mterial, the 
lines showing the same trend in both years. The higher readings of 
pollen in 1952 are very probably due to better climatic and environmental 
conditions, 

The highly significant coirelation indicates conclusively that 

relative pollen production of different lines is consistent from year to 
year. 

The general trend of pollen production in two years Is shown 

in Fig, 1.

applied:- 

= 27.46 (early) 

Xg = 24.32 (late) 

t = 1.40 (D.F. 26) 

The insignificant t value indicates that earliness or late¬ 
ness does not affect pollen production. The relation to the genes for 
pollen production being obvious, the result obtained needs no explanation. 
This finding has importance, however, in the matter of practical selec¬ 
tion. We may conclude that selections for high pollen production will 
not be differential with respect to earliness, and vice versa . 

5* Relationship of Pollen Production to Self-Fertility. 

An experiment to evaluate the correlation between pollen 
production and per cent selfed seed was conducted on several lines of a 
German introduction, which were selected for this purpose because of the 
uniformity within lines and a variability between lines. For this pur¬ 
pose, five heads in each line were selfed, and at matxarity threshed by 
hand. 

Since it was not possible to tell whether seeds were fertile or 
not, by visual observation, it was necessary to examine each kernel 
separately, to determine the percentage of selfed seed. The pollen and 
seed counts were always made from the same head, giving the bivariate 
data necessary^for the computation of the correlation coefficient. 

The correlation coefficient r obtained was 
r » 0.178 


The significance of the correlation coefficient r was tested

by the t test according to Johnson (4), The value obtained, 
t = 1.187, is insignificant, which means that r » 0.178 is not signifi¬ 
cant. 

The r value being insignificant means that there is no 
correlation between the percentage of selfed seed and pollen production 
in the tested lines. Since the percentage of selfed seed depends also on 
genes for self-compatibility, more sanqples in given lines should be 
analyzed to check the variation of correlation in single lines, which 
might fluctxiate with (+) and (-) values around zero. 

Their relation is shown graphically in Fig. 2. 

B - Experiment 2. 

Hybrid Seed Production from Different Proportions of Parental 

Seed in the Sowing Mixture . 

Poor germination, due to unfavorable weather conditions 
during the fall of 1951, caused very unequal stands. Therefore, an 
attempt was made to determine the percentage of hybrid to selfed plants 
by visual observation. These results are given in Tables VI and VII. 

Since no yield data is presented, no test of significance has 
been calculated for the hybridization test. 

These results as presented therefore cannot be cited as sup¬ 
porting or rejecting the effectiveness of visual selection of hybrid 
plants. On the basis of the observation of 1952, the percentage of 
hybrid plants indicates that fewer male plants may be used than has been 
the normal practice in the production of hybrid sunflowers.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 


The results presented suggest that the various characters of 
interest are not all equally amenable to selection. 

In this study, if we consider first the average pollen pro¬ 
duction over the two years, the data within each e^qoeriment are very 
similar. It could also be suggested that observed discrepancies were 
due to climatic and environmental conditions. The result obtained may 
be very useful as a guide in designing future experiments for evaluating 
parental lines. 

The analysis of variance of the data recorded on pollen pro¬ 
duction indicates clearly that the method used is effective for isola¬ 
tion of s\3perior pollen-producing lines and plants. In future this 
method could be extended in analyzing the percentage of viable pollen 
in the lines tested. The estimate of the variance component for specific 
pollen production is very regular and esdiibits the same trend for two 
years. In both years, chance variation arising from sampling appears 
not to have had an inqportant influence on the results obtained for any 
particular line. Some lines may e^daibit improved performance; others 
remain constant, and still others may be inferior when con^ared to 
standard lines. If one extends the original analysis of simple correla¬ 
tion between pollen production and the setting of selfed seed to include, 
as a third variable, data from open pollinated lines, by using a 
multiple correlation test, more information might be obtained. 

The appropriate test of significance in this case depends upon

the specific information the data are expected to provide. Since corre¬ 
lation of pollen production in two years is highly significant, we can 
assume that selection for hi^ pollen production will he effective if the 
objective is to obtain parental lines with high pollen production. 

From the results obtained, it would appear that a lower propor¬ 
tion of male plants are required for production of hybrid seed than is 
commonly used. There may be two approaches to the production of hybrid 
sunflower seed;- 

1. The selection of male parents of very hi^ pollen production 

permitting high set of hybrid seed in the female parent with a minimum 
number of male plants; (Ex.: 2x4; 2x6 or 2x8 row planting). 

2. Reduction of the male parent percentage in mixture combina¬ 
tion as shown in Tables VI and VII. (Ex.: 60 : 40| 70 : 30; 80 : 20; 

90 : 10). 

Such a mixture would permit the harvesting of the entire cross¬ 
ing plot without separation of male and female plants. The data obtained 
in this test, while only from one year, are nevertheless so encouraging 
that this approach to hybrid seed production should be followed up on a 
larger scale. 

An alternative method mi^t be the selection for high pollen 
production in both parents, which might result in high reciprocal crossing. 
Tiis also could be used on the row or seed mixture basis of the above 
methods. 

Normally, selection is practiced for several attributes simul¬ 
taneously. Ihe larger the nimiber of attributes under selection at any

one time, the smaller vill be the selection differential for each charac¬ 
teristic, Now, considering the correlation more specifically, the 
determination of pollen production is not a common practice. If conclu¬ 
sions are to be confined to particular lines used, then the variation 
associated with generations (in the line and between lines) is correctly 
Judged significant. 

Data presented show that a selection between lines and in the 
line itself dxiring the process of sunflower breeding, can be done. 

Visual selection for determining yielding ability must be more 
detailed if it is to provide a good differential. When conditions are 
favorable, the percentage of hybrids are readily classifiable visually, 
whereas differences in yielding ability are much more difficult to 
evaluate. Yield being the most complex from a genetical standpoint and 
most affected by environmental variations, lends itself least to visual 
selection. 

This experiment is now being repeated, in expectation that 
future yield tests will give us the answer concerning relative effective¬ 
ness of the hybridization rates.

SUMMARY 


Two separate experiments were conducted in which sunflower 
lines were tested for their pollen production, and hybridization per¬ 
formance • 

In the first experiment, lines derived from a common source 
were tested for their pollen production. In the second experiment, two 
standard varieties were tested for their combining ability. 

The tested lines differed significantly in their pollen pro¬ 
duction. It was further shown by correlation analysis that these 
differences were maintained over two seasons. It is concluded that the 
technique developed in the investigation can be used advantageously in 
selecting male and female parents in a breeding program. 

E^eriments on mixed seed rates of two standard varieties 
failed to give yield data, and consequently, no definite conclusions 
may be drawn. 

Agriculture and industry are just beginning to recognize the 
sunflower as an iii^jortant source of oil and other siibstances. Since 
this crop has not been intensively studied, future investigators should 
be quite effective in advancing its relative importance, both as to 
production sind utilization.

APPENDIX 


Additional Literature 

To stress the increasing economical importance of this oil 
crop, a number of additional references will be cited at this point, 

Ezra Levin (10), a food chemist in Montebello, Illinois, set 
up a processing plant for sunflower oil production. He used ethylene 
dichloride as a solvent, which literally washes the oil from the crushed 
seed, conserves the food value and acts as a preservative. Since 1945 
the sxmflower is growing in importance as a cash crop in Piatt County, 
Illinois. 

Voropajev and Shtifanova (22) discuss the growing in^ortance 
of sunflower production in Siberia as an oil crop, and state that thirty 
per cent of the oil crop* s acreage in the province of Omsk is actually 
under Sunflower. Gorobeow (5), head of the collective farm, **Molotov” 
reports the issuance of an over-all order to collective farms to seed 
2-5 sunflower rows at 30 - 45 foot spacing on summer fallow, in order 
to catch snow and preserve moisture. Igonin (8) describes the increasing 
practice of winter seeding of sunflowers in the U.S.S.R as a means of 
providing earlier harvesting. 

Bonvincini (2), discussing his results in breeding sunflowers, 
stresses the growing importance of this plant in its contribution to oil 
crops expansion in Italy. Volynzev (23), in a report of the State Com¬ 
mission for Testing Varieties of Grains, Oil Crops and Grasses, states 
that sunflowers have become the basic oil seed crop of the U.S.S.R.

New varieties have been developed with 60 - 66% oil in hull-less seed, 
and with a reduction of the husk percentage to 23 - 24 per cent. 

There has been great interest in Stojkovich*s (18) work in 
developing the new Jugoslav variety, **Novi-Sad 4,” which was tested for 
the first time this year, and also in Tarchinski’s (19) quick method for 
determining oil content during the selection of oil crops. 

Sunflowers being the source of such valiiable products as vege¬ 
table oil, (X- celliilose, pectin and potassium, the potential value of 
research work done on this crop can be readily seen.
