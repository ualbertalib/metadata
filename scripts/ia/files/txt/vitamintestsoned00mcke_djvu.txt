Vitamin A Tests on Edmonton Air Personnel 


The objects of the present investigation are:- 

1. To ascertain the extent of "night-blindness" 
among men in the R.C.A.F. 

. 2. To look for those individuals having an 

exceptionally good night or twilight vision. 

3. To study methods of correcting the condition of 
"night-blindness", with special reference to the use of 
Vitamin A oils and of carotene. 

The investigation was carried out on four Edmonton 
elementary training schools, covering a period from the 
first of June to the end of September, 1941. The testing 
was conducted either at the training school or when more 
convenient at- the Department’s laboratories. 

Basis of the Test :- 

Vitamin A is a necessary factor in the normal 
behavior of the retina. Carried in the blood stream to 
the retina, Vitamin A forms a complex with a protein, the 
visual purple of the rods. Visual purple is destroyed 
by light and until regenerated the individual is relatively 
blind to dim lights. Unless the eye receives a continuous 
supply of Vitamin A the regeneration is incomplete or 
delayed.

Assuming a relationship between the rate of regen¬ 
eration of visual purple and the amount of Vitamin A in 
the blood, many tests for measuring Vitamin A deficiency 
have been proposed, (5) 





























■ ■' '1.‘- • • <; v r 

. ' 




In this Department a test, both sufficiently accurate 
and rapid enough to permit the treating of large numbers 
of people, was developed by Dr. L. B. Pett. (1) This 
visual test has been correlated with blood analysis for 
the vitamin. (2) 

Method of Testing ;- 

In brief, this test consists in identifying a dim 
bar of light after looking at a bright light for 30 seconds* 
The time taken to identify the bar of light, after the 
bright light is turned off, is noted, and this represents 
the "recovery time". Two or three tests are repeated at 
one minute intervals and the mean of the values is taken. 
People with recovery time of 10 seconds or less are 

considered normal . 

The men were paraded for the test and one operator 
handled thirty men an hour. To those found deficient 
100,000 I.XJ. of Vitamin A was given - either as carotene 
(10 capsules) or fish oils (3 capsules). Those treated 
men were retested later and treatment continued until 
normal ranges were obtained or until lowering of their 
values could be obtained. 

Results and Discussion 

The frequency distribution curve of the total number 
tested is shown in figure 1. The graph shows a peak of 
6 seconds and 88$ of the men fall in the normal range.

This may be compared with results from over 4000 persons 
tested at this University, showing only 43% in the normal 
range with a peak at 10 seconds. The men having except¬ 
ionally good dark adaptation, that is, those with recovery 
times of 4 seconds or less, made up approximately 12% of 
the total. These men would possibly make good night 
fighters. (4) 

Table I shows recovery times of the personnel of 
each school tested. The results vary widely in different 
schools - from 3% deficient in the Radio School to 24% 
deficient in No. 2 A.O.S. and the deficiencies are high 
enough to warrant attention in men engaged in night 
operation. 

Response to Treatment ?- 

Treatment is usually carried out by giving Vitamin A 
from some fish liver oil, or by giving the provitamin 
carotene. Since there is some question about the adequacy 
of supplies of fish liver oils in Canada and Britain, 
during the war, it is considered especially important to 
consider the results with carotene, which is prepared from 
vegetables. 

Table 2 gives details of the response to carotene, 

Table 3 to Vitamin A and Table 4 some individual results on 
repeated treatments. 

Results with Carotene :- First dosage 100,000 I.U. in 3 days.

Sixty percent of all deficients did not return to 
normal with the first dosage. However, a lowering of 
the recovery time was usually noted and the continued 
treatment for those still deficient ultimately restored 
all to normal except 6#. Of those with moderate def¬ 
iciencies only 19# did not respond to the first treatment. 
Table 4 shows the importance of using bile salts in some 
cases needing treatment. Also shown are a few cases not 
restored to normal by carotene, even with associated 
riboflavin and ascorbic acid. Vitamin A was always effect¬ 
ive.

Results with Vitamin A :- 100,000 I.U. in 3 days 

Nearly 40% of all deficients did not return to normal 
with the first treatment. Of cases with recovery times 
from 11 to 15 seconds, only 19% did not return to normal 
with the first 100.000 I.U. given, this being the same 
as with carotene. 

Only five deficients (6%) in all the numbers treated 
showed no lowering of their recovery times with repeated 
large dosages. 

No one dosage is satisfactory to cure all cases. 
Freauent retesting of all deficients with additional 
dosages when reauired is advised. 

Summary 

1. Using the Pett Vitometer it was possible for 
one operator to test air personnel at the rate of 30 
men an hour. 

2. Of the total number of men (706) tested, 12% 
were found to be deficient in Vitamin A. 

3. The percentages of deficients varied from 3 to 
24% in the various schools or groups tested, 

4. Twelve percent showed exceptionally good dark 
adaptation. 

5. With 100,000 I.U. of carotene over a three-day 
period 40% *of the deficients were brought to normal. 

Further treatment restored most of the remainder.

6. With 100,000 I.U. of Vitamin A given as fish 
liver oils over a three day period, 60$ of all deficients 
treated were brought to a normal recovery time. 

7. Ninety-four percent of all deficients were brought 
to a normal level after one or more treatments. No one 
dosage was found to be effective in all cases. Bile salts 
were sometimes necessary. Retesting was the only means of 
being certain of the results. 

Conclusions 

While the number of persons lacking Vitamin A among 
the air personnel is low, there are still enough to be an 
important factor. The testing period included the months 
where the lowest number of deficiencies have been found in 
other investigations. Winter, with its lack of fresh 
vegetables and fruits shows a marked rise in the numbers 
of deficients found. Since the number requiring treatment 
is small, indiscriminate feeding of Vitamin A to all 
personnel would be wasteful. This would be especially 
serious in view of the uncertainty of supplies of fish 
oils.

THE BASIC LEAD PRECIPITATE FROM URINE 
Introduction 


A number of substances of doubtful composition, 
possibly peptides or partially oxidized protein fragments, 
have been isolated from human urine. These substances, 
escaping complete metabolism by the body, are termed 
oxyproteic, antoxyproteic, and alloxyproteic acid by their 
isolators, Bondzynski, Dombrowski and Panck (1). In the 
same class is the uroferric acid of Thiele (2). 

Subsequent workers are not in agreement with regard 
to the nature ot the hydrolytic products of the so-called 
proteic acids. Even from the writings of the original 
authors, no hint is given that these substances were 
isolated, other than in an amorphous, impure state. 

However,’ according to Folin quoted by Allen £3), 
three to seven percent of the total urinary nitrogen is 
still unaccounted for, other than as proteic acids. A 
similar small part of the urinary sulphur is also 
attributed to these acids. 


The elementary analyses of the acids as given by the 
authors (3) along with their reactions to Erlich*s diazo 
test, are:

They do not give the common protein tests* 

Since there is much uncertainty about the composition 
of these substances further research into the nature of 
the acids is clearly called for. The author’s isolation 
procedures were found unworkable and no serious attempt 
to follow their laborious and detailed instruction was 
made. 

The purpose of the present investigation is to 
elucidate the nature of the substances in the basic 
lead acetate precipitate of normal urine. It is in this 
fraction that the substance responsible for Ehrlich’s 
diazo test in the urine of fibrile patients is found: a 
substance which has been called urochromogen by Weiss 
(4), as it appears to be the chromogen of the normal 
urinary pigment, urochrome. Various unsuccessful attempts 
have been made in this laboratory and elsewhere to isolate 
the substance in question. It is relatively unstable and 
observations have suggested that its instability is increased 
with high H-ion concentration. Under the usual conditions 
of obtaining the basic lead precipitate, when the lead 
salt.is freed with hydrogen sulphide the resulting solution, 
is always very strongly acid. It had previously been 
observed that when sulphuric acid is used to free the lead 
salt (instead of hydrogen sulphide), the lead is not all 
freed when the solution is just acid to Congo Red. It was 
thought that this acid effect might be due to the so-called

proteic acid, to which group it is possible, urochromogen 
belongs. But as the freeing of the lead salts by hydrogen 
sulphide or sulphuric acid was inevitably accompanied by 
a high H-icin concentration, it was thought possible to 
exchange the lead in the salt for potassium by shaking 
with a potassium sulphate solution. On such an assumption, 
which has subsequently proved to be erroneous, and by certain 
fractionation procedures, a crystalline potassium salt 
was prepared from this fraction. The nature and origin of 
this potassium salt is described. 

So far as present observations have gone it also 
appears that the above mentioned "acid effect" is due 
largely to hydrochloric acid arising from chloride in 
urine: as much of the chloride may not be precipitated 
in the acid lead fraction of urine. Such observations 
have altered our approach to the problem. Urine must 
be freed from chloride before proceeding with the lead 
fractionation. 


EXPERIMENTAL 

Lead Fractionation of Urine 

In the initial stages of the investigation, the 
method of collecting the urine was the same as one used in 
this laboratory when collecting urine from typhoid patients, 
for determining "urochromogen " levels. The quantity of lead

acetate used ensured an excess for urines of all concentra¬ 
tions. 

Urine was collected with one third of its volume of 
40 percent lead acetate. After standing overnight, the 
supernatant was poured off and the precipitate discarded. 

Two normal potassium hydroxide was added to the clear 
greenish supernatant, to bring the pH to 7.5. The lead 
precipitate, insoluble at this pH, was allowed to settle 
overnight in the refrigerator. The supernatant was 
siphoned off and discarded and the precipitate collected 
in centrifuge bottles, washed twice with water and three 
times with acetone to obtain a dry lead precipitate. (by 
this means it is possible to store the lead salt of 
urochromogen over long periods without decomposition.) 

Five grams of the lead salt was ground with 15 ml. 
of absolute methanol and 7.5 ml. of 5N sulphuric acid in 
absolute methanol. This shifted the pH to slight acidity 
with Congo Red. A saturated solution of potassium sulphate 
was added until there was a slight excess of sulphate ion. 
After centrifuging off the lead sulphate and evaporating 
in vacuo, to the beginning of crystals, the solution was 
dried in a desiccator. The dark brown mass was extracted 
with dry, alcohol-free ethyl ether: the extract was poured 
into a small basin and allowed to volatilize in the open. 
This gave a yellow, slow-drying sticky mass, showing a fern¬ 
like crystal pattern.

The residue from the ether extraction was ground with 
absolute ethanol, washed several times with absolute 
ethanol, evaporated under reduced pressure, and dried in 
a vacuum desiccator. 

The residue was then extracted with absolute methan¬ 
ol. The methanol soluble fraction was evaporated under 
reduced pressure to the beginning of crystallization, 
some absolute ethanol added and left to crystallize in 
the refrigerator. This gave well formed crystals, only 
slightly colored. 

Various attempts to purify the crystals from the 
methanol extraction were tried, including recrystallization 
from hot methanol. Finally this portion was dried in the 
desiccator, dissolved in methanol, and heated to near 
boiling with animal charcoal. This gave an almost color¬ 
less liquid which on cooling gave white crystals. A 
melting point determination showed charring at 170° C 
and fusing at 220° C. 

The preparation was modified as follows: after the 
solution was freed of excess lead ion and diluted with 
water it was boiled with bone charcoal, centrifuged and 
boiled again with charcoal. The water clear solution was 
evaporated under reduced pressure, dried in a desiccator, 
and extracted with absolute ethanol. The residue was 
extracted with absolute methanol and the remaining methanol 
insoluble portion dissolved in hot water. The methanol

soluble portion after drying in a desiccator was re¬ 
crystallized from hot methanol, vacuum filtered, and washed 
with absolute ethanol. This gave white clear plate-like 
crystals, melting point 228 °C with no charring preceding 
melting. The crystals were very soluble in hot or cold 
water, very soluble in hot absolute methanol, insoluble 
in ether or benzene. After fusion with sodium, sulphur 
was strongly positive, nitrogen and phosphorus and halogens 
were negative. 

Crystalline Potassium Salt 

On ignition in a platinum boat the substance melted, 
and without appreciable charring left a large white residue 
in which only sulphur and potassium could be detected. 
Evidently the crystals isolated were the potassium salt 
of a relatively simple substance, probably a sulphonic 
acid. The ease with which the potassium salt hydrolized 
to sulphuric acid suggested the presence of ethereal 
sulphates. To demonstrate this, to a solution of the 
potassium salt in water was added one third of its volume 
of strong hydrochloric acid. The solution was boiled for 
five minutes and barium chloride added—a white cloud of 
barium sulphate formed. The compound was apparently a 
potassium salt of a sulphonic acid of the type RS0 3 K. 

Attempts were now made to obtain the free acid from 
this potassium salt. To an aqueous solution of the salt

lead acetate solution was added and the pH raised to about 
8.0. There was no precipitate. 

To some of the lead salts suspended in water 2N 
sulphuric acid was added and the excess sulphate was 
removed with barium hydroxide. After centrifuging off the 
barium sulphate arid drying the free acid in a desiccator 
nothing was obtained. 

Hydrogen sulphide was passed into a suspension of 
the lead salt in water and the excess hydrogen sulphide 
removed by boiling. This solution was acid to litmus 
and Congo Red paper and free sulphuric acid was present 
since it gave a positive test with barium chloride and 
hydrochloric acid. 

The only conclusion possible from the above findings* 
and assuming no significant decomposition of the substances 
in question* is that this potassium salt was introduced 
from our reagents. 

Further examination of the potassium salt proved the 
absence of nitrogen by micro-Kjeldahl determination. 

By the method of Warunis (5) sulphur determination 
showed 21.77 and 21.07%. 

Several methods were tried for the determination of 
potassium. The method of Pregl (6) failed in our hands 
to give uniform values. A dipicrylamine method (7) also 
failed to give consistent values.

Finally the chloroplatinate method (8) was adopted 
and yielded values of 25.96, 26.17, 25.90 and 25.93$ K. 
Through the kindness of Mr. J.M.Lockwood, Division of 
Chemistry, National Research Council, Hydrogen and Carbon 
values were made available. 

The salt in question is thus CH 3 S0 3 K, as proved by 
the following average analysis:

This material was formed in the mixed reagent used, 
composed of concentrated sulphuric acid and methanol, as 
proved by isolation. 

Conditions for Lead Fractionation 
a. Lead Requirement 

Having disposed of this misleading finding, a 
return was now made to the lead fractionation with a view 
first to defining conditions. The first of these was to 
determine the requisite amount of lead required by the 
urine. The principle used here is as follows: Ammonium 
hydroxide is chosen as base to raise the pH of aliquot 
portions, as there is little evidence that any lead salts 
are dissolved by addition of excess ammonium hydroxide, 
whereas, it is well known that there is appreciable re¬ 
solution of lead salts in excess sodium hydroxide or pot¬ 
assium hydroxide. Accordingly, 2 ml. aliquot portions of

the urine to be fractionated were set up and varying 
amounts of 40% lead acetate added to each. A definite 
excess of ammonium hydroxide was then added to each. 

The mixed tubes were centrifuged and to a few drops of 
the supernatant from each, 5 N sulphuric acid was added. 

A precipitate of lead sulphate then shows an excess of 
lead, and the amount of lead acetate to be added to the 
main urine can thus be determined precisely. 

The requisite amount of 40% lead acetate was added 
to the urine and the pH adjusted to near 5.0. The precipi- 
tate formed here is composed largely of lead salts of 
phosphate, sulphate, chloride, carbonate, and various 
organic materials, such as uric acid and urinary pigments. 
This precipitate is separated and discarded. 

To the filtrate, 2 N potassium hydroxide is added 
to raise the pH to about 9.0. This precipitate is 
separated and washed, suspended in water, and treated with 
hydrogen sulphide. The lead sulphide is removed, and the 
hydrogen sulphide removed from the filtrate. 

Interference of Chloride 

The filtrate at this point is invariably found to be very 
strongly acid, due to the presence of hydrochloric acid. 

We had erroneously assumed (on the basis of sol¬ 
ubilities of lead chloride in water) that there would be 
no appreciable lead chloride in a well washed basic lead

precipitate. This error was corrected by the isolation 
of potassium chloride crystals from this fraction. 

We have found that in urines where the concentration 
of sodium chloride is less than 4 gm/l, that chloride 
is precipitated in all pH ranges. Dilution of urine well 
below the solubilities of lead chloride in water is no 
assurance that the lead precipitates will not contain 
chloride. 

The presence of lead chloride in the basic lead 
precipitate appreciably increases the bulk of the 
precipitates and leads to confusion in reaction as 
previously mentioned. This has no doubt been a confusing 
factor in much of the earlier work on proteic acids. It 
was thus decided that chloride should be removed from all 
urines before undertaking the lead fractionation. This 
can readily be done as follows: 

Removal of Chloride from Urine 

1 ml. urine delivered into a 50 ml. centrifuge tube 
is diluted with approximately an equal volume of water,2 ml. 
of the standard silver nitrate-nitric acid mixture added 
(1 ml.=0.01 gm. NaCl), mixed, and 1 drop of caprylic 
alcohol to depress the solubility of the AgCl is added. (9) 
The tube is centrifuged and titrated with standard thio¬ 
cyanate and the silver nitrate requirement thus determined.

To the urine to be fractionated, and with the pH 
definitely on the acid side of neutrality, an aqueous 
solution of silver nitrate (1 ml.=0.1 gm NaCl) is added 
according to the above determination. If excess is avoided 
the precipitate readily coagulates and can be easily 
separated. 

A further advantage in thus removing chloride lies 
in the fact that the lead reauirement can be more accur¬ 
ately determined by the method already described. 

The lead precipitate thus obtained in the range 
pH 5.0 -9.0 yields a solution after removal of lead and 
hydrogen sulphide having a pH 3 - 4. 

Fractionation on Chloride Free Urine 

This solution has been refractionated by Pb in the 
pH ranges 5.0 - 6.8 and 6.8 - 9.0. The precipitate obtained 
in the more acid range is small and highly pigmented. The 
main material under investigation is thus to be found in 
the pH range 6.8 - 9.0. 

This fraction yielded no crystalline material on 
evaporation and so far it has not been possible to prepare 
a crystalline salt. That the fraction is still complex is 
indicated by its behaviour in the silver-baryta fraction¬ 
ation to be described. A mercury precipitation was 
carried out as follows:

Mercury Precipitation 

Mixed urines in approximately 2 litre lots were put 
through the lead fractionation procedure and the aqueous 
solution of free acid thus obtained was subjected to 
a mercury fractionation. The mercury requirement of each 
urine was determined on an aliquot portion: to 1 ml. of 
the free acid solution was added 5% mercuric acetate 
until no further precipitate was obtained. The mixture 
was adjusted to just acid with 5$ sodium carbonate solution. 
Another drop of mercury was added and if there was no 
further precipitate sufficient mercury had been added. A 
red precipitate of mercuric oxide indicated an excess of 
mercury. The main precipitate was washed twice with water 
containing a little sodium carbonate and the supernatant 
and washings saved. The precipitate suspended in water 
was freed with hydrogen sulphide and the mercuric sulphide 
centrifuged off and discarded after one washing. The 
filtrate and washing was aerated with a stream of carbon 
dioxide and concentrated in vacuo to dryness. This gave 
a yellow colored mass showing some fern-like pattern. 

The material was extremely soluble in water, insoluble in 
absolute alchhol, but soluble in 95% alcohol. 

One sample of urine put through the preceding 
two fractionations showed the following:

The total sulphur analysis shows that most of the 
sulphur precipitated by lead at pH 6.8-9.0 is reprecip¬ 
itated by mercury. 

Adding absolute alcohol slowly with warming to the 
concentrated solution from the mercury fractionation 
procedure gave a sticky mass of yellow crystals. Attempts 
to remove the sticky yellow pigments were unsuccessful 
since the material was unstable and oxidized to a brown mass. 

SILVER FRACTIONATION 

The freed mercury precipitates from fresh urines 
samples were put through a silver fractionation. 10 % 
silver nitrate was added to the solution from a mercury 
fractionation until an excess was present as shown by 
the formation of an immediate brown spot test with concen¬ 
trated barium hydroxide solution. The light precipitate 
that formed was left in solution. A hot saturated solution 
of barium hydroxide was added until the solution had 
reached a pH of 7.0. The relatively small precipitate 
was centrifuged off and washed. Excess barium hydroxide 
was then added to the filtrate and the precipitate similarly 
collected. The two precipitates and the filtrate were

made acid to Congo Red with sulphuric acid and the silver 
freed with hydrogen sulphide. The hydrogen sulphide 
was removed with a stream of carbon dioxide and by evacuation 
on the vacuum pump. Excess sulphuric acid was removed 
from the three solutions with barium hydroxide solution. 

The solutions were reprecipitated with lead acetate and 
the lead salts after washing were freed in the usual way. 

The three solutions were evaporated to dryness on the vacuum 
pump. 

Silver precipitation revealed the mixture to be 
complex. The freed material from the first silver precipit¬ 
ation yielded a small quantity of heavy brown liquid. 

The second freed precipitate was larger and gave a yellow 
amorphous powder. About half of the bulk of the mixture 
was obtained from the filtrate as a red brown syrup. 

No crystals were obtained from the above material. 

Sulphur Analysis 

(a) Methods 

Inorganic ethereal and neutral sulphur and total 
sulphur was determined on the native urine and on the 
various lead fractions. The results were expressed as 
sulphur. 

The Fiske’s Benzidine titration method (10) was tried 
first and found satisfactory only for native urine. Even 
on native urine Benedict’s total sulphur reagent of copper 
nitrate and potassium chlorate, is of doubtful value as 
an oxidizing agent. On applying the benzidine titration

method to the filtrates after the removal of each lead 
fraction, acetate, nitrate and phosphate ions titrated 
with NaOH in the same way as benzidine sulphate. 

Gravimetric methods were adopted. Sulphur determinat¬ 
ions were done on the native urine and on the lead prec¬ 
ipitates collected at pH 5.0 and pH 9.0 and on the 
supernatant. Each precipitate was collected in a centrifuge 
bottle, washed once with water and the washing added 
to the filtrate. The precipitates and the filtrate 
were freed of lead with hydrogen sulphide and the 
hydrogen sulphide removed with carbon dioxide. 

The Warunis (5) method for total sulphur was found 
to be very accurate when total sulphur was determined 
in pure cystine. However, applied to urine, the method 
was not satisfactory: urine adhered to the crucible 
during evaporation and complete fusion was questionable. 

The results on duplicate samples varied as much as 4%. 

Denis 1 modification of Benedict’s method (11) 
using a solution <&f copper nitrate, sodium chloride and 
ammonium nitrate, did away with spattering and duplicate 
results checked closely* 

Inorganic and ethereal sulphur was determined by 
Folin’s method (12). To 25 ml. of urine and 15 ml. of 
water are added 6 ml. of 5N HCl and 10 ml. of 10% 
barium chloride. After standing for about an hour the

solution is filtered through a weighed Gooch crucible 
and the inorganic sulphur determined. The filtrate 
is boiled gently for thirty minutes, cooled, and 
filtered and the ethereal sulphur determined. The 
organic sulphur was arrived at by subtracting the 
sum of the inorganic and ethereal from the total 
sulphur. 

Every series of determinations showed a loss of 
sulphur. The total sulphur of the lead fraction at 
pH 5.0 and 9.0 plus the supernatant sulphur was less 
than the total sulphur of the native urine. 

When acidified urine was boiled hydrogen 
sulphide was generated, as proved by blackening a 
solution of lead acetate. Also urine evaporated to 
dryness with the oxidation mixture gave rise to some 
hydrogen sulphide. 

Four total sulphur determinations were done on 
the same urine sample: 

I (a) J5 ml. native urine—23.1 mg. S 
(b) " " " " —23.0 " S 

II (a) 25 ml. urine boiled with HC1-—20.1 mg. S

It is thought the loss of sulphur in the above 
determination occurs in the inorganic sulphur fractions 
below pH 5.0, probably due to the incomplete freeing 
of the very stable lead sulphate. However, it is 
interesting to study the neutral sulphur partition. 

In each determination approximately three quarters of 
the neutral sulphur was not precipitated by lead. 
Presumably the one quarter of the neutral sulphur 
precipitated by lead at pH 5.0 to 9.0 corresponds to 
the alloxyproteic acid fraction. 

(c) Loss of Sulnhur 

Even though organic sulphur is lost as hydrogen 
sulphide when boiling with HC1 for the determination 
of ethereal sulphur this loss is irrelevant since the

organic sulphur is arrived at by the difference 
between the inorganic and the total sulphurs. To 
account for the loss of sulphur the following 
possibilities were considered: 

1. The method of Denis may be inapplicable: 

a. To determining the S-3 linkage 

b. To determining the 3-H linkage. 

2. Precipitation with lead acetate and subsequent 
freeing with hydrogen sulphide may bring about 
a loss.

Thus it would appear a loss of sulphur occurs 
because of an inability to completely free the 
lead salt with hydrogen sulphide. Either the pH is 
not low enough to free the lead sulphate or the 
physical properties of the urinary lead salts 
interfere with the complete freeing.

Erfaothioneine-l4ke Substances 

Sullivan and Hess (13) claim to have isolated 
ergothioneine-like material from normal urine. This 
material behaved like ergothioneine in that it reacted 
with the Folin-Marenzi (14) uric acid .reagent and* 
gave a red color with Hunter’s diazo reagent (15). 
Analyzed for nitrogen and sulphur it gave nitrogen 
15.26$, sulphur 11.95$, closely agreeing with the 
calculated values for ergothioneine hydrochloride: 
nitrogen 15.81$, sulphur 12.0?$. The free base melted 
at 261° and decomposed between 285-290°. The authors 
stated at the end of their paper that most of the 
material isolated did not seem to be ergothioneine. 

If the claims of the authors could be substantiated 
some light might be thrown on the nature of the 
unknown sulphur compounds in urine. 

Isolation Procedure 

A modified Hunter and Eagles (16) procedure, used 
for the isolation of ergothioneine in blood, was 
followed. Four litres of normal urine was brought to 
pH 5.0 by the addition of glacial acetic acid. Goulard’s 
reagent (17) was added until a test portion of the

supernatant showed an excess of lead on testing 
with sulphuric acid. The filtrate was freed of 
lead by hydrogen sulphide and the hydrogen sulphide 
removed with a stream of carbon dioxide. A 
saturated alcoholic solution of mercuric chloride 
was added to the filtrate until no further 
precipitation occurred. The mercury precipitate was 
washed twice and freed with hydrogen sulphide. The 
mercury sulphide was thoroughly washed and the 
washings added to the filtrate. The filtrate was 
freed of hydrogen sulphide as before, made to 0.5N 
by the addition of lON sulphuric acid and precipitated 
with 20% phosphotungstic acid in 0.5N sulphuric acid 
until precipitation ceased. The pinkish precipitate 
was allowed to stand in the refrigerator over night. 
The phosphotungstic precipitate was centrifuged off 
in the morning, keeping the temperature as low as 
possible and the precipitate was washed twice with ice 
cold 0.5N sulphuric acid to which had been added a 
little of the phosphotungstic acid solution (5 mis./ 
100 ml. of 0.5N sulphuric acid).

The precipitate was freed with a hot saturated 
solution of barium hydroxide, the latter added until 
the solution tested definitely alkaline to litmus. 

The filtrate was carefully freed from barium by 
adding 5N sulphuric acid until the end of precipitation 
and then a quantitative removal of barium and sulphate 
was accomplished with 0.1N solutions of barium 
hydroxide and sulphuric acid. The filtrate was 
concentrated under reduced pressure to about 15 ml. and 
a great deal of material separated out. The great bulk 
of this material was creatinine. However it gave a 
positive diazo test for histidine and a small amount cf 
histidine was isolated from the material. The material 
freed from the mass of creatinine with picric acid 
gave a stable dark red nitroprusside test, instead of 
the characteristically unstable purple red reaction with 
sulphydryl groups. 

Benedict, Newton, and B ehre (18) showed that 
ergothioneine is precipitated by 5% silver lactate in 
5% lactic acid but is not freed by washing with a 10% 
solution of sodium chloride in 0.1N hydrochloric acid. 
Ergothioneine can thus be separated from uric acid which 
is extracted by acid sodium chloride from the silver 
precipitate.

The concentrated filtrate from the freed 
phosphotungstic acid precipitate and with the separated 
creatinine removed was treated with silver lactate in 
slight excess. The silver precipitate was centrifuged 
off and the supernatant saved. The silver precipitate 
was washed several times with the acid sodium 
chloride solution until a supernatant gave a negative 
reaction with the Folin-Marenzi uric acid reagent. 

The precipitate was then boiled for five minutes with 
10 ml. of 0.5N hydrochloric acid and the filtrate 
left over night in the refrigerator—nothing separated 
out. The filtrate was concentrated to approximately 
1 ml. and an equal volume of absolute alcohol was 
added slowly to the warmed solution. After standing 
for sevdral hours in the refrigerator the small 
amount of white material that had separated out was 
collected in a small sintered glass funnel, washed 
with absolute alcohol, and dried in a desiccator. 

This material proved to be mostly uric acid and showed 
no traces of either ergothioneine or * histidine. 
Evidently the silver lactate precipitate was not washed 
enough with the acid sodium chloride solution to remove 


all the uric acid

it was also found the silver lactate reagent would 
precipitate part of the histidine from a fairly 
concentrated histidine solution. Also a careful 
distinction must be made between the orange red 
color that histidine gives with Hunter’s diazo 
reagent for ergothioneine and the bright purple red 
color given by ergothioneine. In addition, even 
dilute test solutions of ergothioneine smell of 
trimethylamine on standing with the strong sodium 
hydroxide used in the test. 

The filtrate from the silver lactate precipitate 
was examined, A large quantity of creatinine was 
removed from the solution as the monopicrate, care 
being taken to keep the volume and temperature low to 
limit the solubility of creatinine monopicrate. The 
filtrate was freed of excess picric acid by the 
addition of hydrochloric acid and extraction of the 
picric acid with benzene. The solution was then 
clarified with bone charcoal and reduced to a small 
volume. The addition of absolute alcohol brought down 
a white precipitate which proved to be histidine. ^o 
ergothioneine was detected.

CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY 

1. An investigation was made of the basic lead 
precipitate from urine. 

2. A crystalline potassium salt introduced from 
the reagents has been described. 

3. The strong acidity of the freed lead salts, 
thought to be due to proteic acids, is due 
largely to hydrochloric acid arising from the 
chloride in urine. 

4* The unstable material from lead, mercury, and 
silver precipitation methods yielded no new 
substances. 

5. Most of the organic sulphur compounds are to 
be found in the supernatant from lead 
precipitation at pH 9.0. 

6. A fractionation of the supernatant after a 
preliminary lead precipitation yielded no new 
sulphur compounds.
