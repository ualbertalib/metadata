PART 1 

THE SYNTHESIS OF DIBENZOTHIOPHENE AND SOME DERIVATIVES 
CO ATTAINING RADIOSULFUR 

INTRODUCTION 

The compound 3-acetylaminodibenzothiophene recently 

synthesized by Brown, Christiansen and Sandin 1 has been 

2 

found by Miller, Miller, Sandin and Brown to exhibit 
carcinogenicity in rats. A control compound, 

2- acetylaminoflourene, causes cancer in ear duct tissue, 
mammary glands and the liver. However 3-acetylaminodiben- 
zothiophene, math a sulfur bridge replacing the methylene 
group, exhibited no carcinogenicity towards the liver while 
retaining the ability to cause cancer in ear duct and 
mammary tissue. Forthese reasons a synthesis of 

3- acetylaminodibenzothiophene labelled with radio-active 
sulfur-35 was carried out so that the fate of the material 
in the rat might be followed with the hope of gaining 
more information on the problem of carcinogenesis. 

Dibenzothiophene-5-dioxide has been reduced to 
dibenzothiophene by heating with elemental sulfur* 5 ’ 4 .

Similarly when dibenzothiophene-5-dioxide is heated 

5 

with selenium , the product is dibenzoselenophene 

6 

and the corresponding telluride is formed when tellurium 
is used. 



From the above reactions it seems reasonable to 


believe that the mechanism of the reduction to dibenzo- 
thiophene is not a removal of the oxygen from the sulfur, 


but rather a complete replacement of the group by a 
sulfur atom according to the following equation (I). 



This mechanism is also substantiated by the fact that 
sulfones are very difficult to reduce to sulfides. 


Another possible mechanism to explain the form¬ 
ation of selenides and tellurides would be an initial 
reduction followed by a replacement reaction as follows 
in equations (II).

An excellent method for establishing the mechanism 
of the reaction was to use radioactive sulfur in the 
reaction to find out if the reaction is simply a re¬ 
duction or really an interchange* If a simple reduction 
occurs as in equation III, 


III. 




+ sK 


then the specific activity of the resulting sulfur- 
dioxide should be of the same order as the specific 
activity of the elemental radiosulfurtBed. Also the 
resulting dibenzothiophene would be inactive. If a 
two step mechanism similar to II is the predominating 
reaction, then both the sulfur-dioxide and the di¬ 
benzothiophene should be active. If, however, the 
reaction is as in equation I, then the resulting 
sulfur-dioxide would be inactive and the dibenzothiophene 
would have the same specific activity as the original 


sulfur. 

In view 7 of the fact that the resulting dibenzo-

thiophene would be labelled if equation I occurs, 
this reaction was investigated as a possible source 
of radioactive dibenzothiophene for the production 
of labelled 3-aeetylaminodibenzothiophene. 

There have been a number of sulfur exchanges reported, 
10 

In 1939, Voge reported the following: 

(a) A complete and rapid exchange occurred even at room 
temperature between sulfur atoms in polysulfide ion, 

(b) The exchange reaction between sulfide and thiosulfate 
ions was substantially complete after 24 hours at 100°. 

(c) Sulfite-thiosulfate exchange according to the 
equation below and was found to be complete after one 
hour at 100° or 21 hours at 57°. 

s*0/ + SzOf ss*0f + so 3 = 

(d) There was no appreciable exchange between sulfide- 
sulfate or sulfite-sulfate even after 36 hours at 100°. 

(e) Sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide did not exchange 
at temperatures appreciable below those at which dis¬ 
sociation of the trioxide might be expected. This was 
found to be true also in the presence of platinum or 
water, 

11 

Cooley, Yost and McMillan have shown that there 
is no appreciable interchange between sulfur and carbon 
disulfide even at 100°so that carbon disulfide may be 
used as a solvent for radio-sulfur without fear of loss 
by interchange.

DISCUSSION 

The following flow sheet shows the route of 
synthesis followed* 



Dibenzothiophene was prepared according to the 

4 

method of Gilman and Jacoby , and converted to the 

-5-dioxide in excellent yield by oxidation with hydrogen 

peroxide in glacial acetic acid according to the method 

7 

outlined by Gilman and Nobis . The conversion of 
dibenzothiophene to the 3-acetylamino derivative was 
carried out essentially by the method of Brown, 
Christiansen and Sandin\

Before using radioactive sulfur, the complete 
series of reactions were performed many times until 
optimum conditions were found and reproducible re¬ 
sults obtained. Also it was necessary to be able to 
take care of all waste products in order to eliminate 
the danger of radioactive contamination and to prevent 
health hazards. For these reasons a detailed description 
of the apparatus and techniques used will be given in the 
experimental procedure* 

Determination of radioactivity. Sulfur-35 is a very 
8 

weak beta emitter with half life of 87*1 days and 
beta radiation of 0.107 Mev. (0.17 Mev.) maximum energy. 
For this reason a special windowless, methane-filled 
counter was used. The author was allowed the use of this 
instrument through the very kind permission of Dr. Samuel 
Kirkwood, National Research Council, Ottawa. The counter, 
a "Nucleometer” made by Radiations Counter Laboratories, 
Chicago, was specially designed to count beta particles 
from such weak emitters as carbon-14 and sulfur-35. The 
geometry was 50$. The plateau region was in the vicinity 
of 4500 volts with the centre wire positively charged. 

The counter was operated in an air conditioned room with 
both temperature and humidity automatically maintained 
constant.

In all cases samples were counted in infinit&y 

thick layers and corrections made for self-absorption 

8 

as discussed theoretically by Libby . For an infin¬ 
itely thick layer i.e. a layer thicker than the range 
(which is 15 mg. per square cm. for S ) we have

where cr = specific activity in microcuries per gram, 
Ico =s count rate measured from a sample with area

The sample dishes used had an area A of 10*3 
square cm. so that the specific activity was

The specific activity of the sulfur dioxide 
resulting from the exchange reaction was less than 
2% of the specific activity of the original sulfur 
thus indicating definitely that reactions II and III 
do not occur to any appreciable extent* Furthermore, 
the specific activity of the resulting dibenzothiophene 
was the same as that of the original sulfur, indicating 
that equation I is the probable reaction* 

The activity of the labelled dibenzothiophene 
was also exhibited by each successive derivative thus 
showing that the activity was in the molecule and not 
carried as an adsorbed impurity.

Initial results from rat experiments with 
the labelled 3-acetylaminodibenzothiophene indicate 

f7(T 

the following: a) No volatile S compounds were found 

in expired air* b) A very large share of isotope was 

excreted in some form in the urine* c) Unlike azo dyes, 

it appears that ear and mammary tumors bind a definite 
35 

amount of some S compound in their proteins, d) The 
normal tissues vary widely in this respect; blood proteins 
are high in activity. 

For a simple theory of action, it does not seem 
that the amount of this binding can be correlated with 
the susceptibilities of the various tissues to the 
carcinogenicity of the parent compound.

Preparation of S Labelled Elemental Sulfur . 

Barium sulfate (0*2076 g. specific activity 0.0687 
millicuries per mole) was reduced to barium sulfide in a 
stream of purified hydrogen at 900-950°c. for three hours. 

The barium sulfide was then treated with oxygen free phos¬ 
phoric acid in an atmosphere of nitrogen and the resulting 
hydrogen sulfide was trapped in three bubbler tubes, each 
containing 2 ml. of 1 N. sodium hydroxide. 

The resulting solution of sodium sulfide was diluted 
with 0.2645 g. of nonisotopic sodium sulfide then introduced 
by means of a very fine pipette below the surface of the 
acidified (hydrochloric acid) solution of iodine in 
potassium iodide contained in a 50 ml. centrifuge cone. The 
resulting elemental sulfur was allowed to digest for 15 
minutes, then the excess iodine was destroyed by the addition 
of stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid. The sulfur 
coagulated overnight and was centrifuged down and washed with 
stannous chloride in hydrochloric acid when with water. The 
sulfur so produced was in a form insoluble in carbon disulfide. 
To render the sulfur soluble, the tube containing the sulfur 
was heated for several minutes in a bath of boiling m-xylene. 
This treatment produced a soluble product. At this point 
it would have been desirable to count the activity of the 
elemental sulfur so produced; however it was found that 
sulfur in the counting volume produced a contamination

For this reason the specific activity of elemental sulfur 
was calculated from the measured activity of the initial 
barium sulfate and found to be 0*0143 millicuries per mole.

S Labelled Dibenzothiophene. The carbon disulfide solution 
of active sulfur was transferred to a 15 ml. exchange flask 
which contained 2.6 g. of dibenzothiophene-5-dioxide. The 
volatile disulfide was carefully removed at the pump. The 
flask was then heated in a nitrite-nitrate salt bath after 
supplying a dry, inert atmosphere of nitrogen which was also 
used to sweep the evolved gases into three bubbler tubes, 
the first and second of which each contained 3 ml. of a 
solution of 0.1 M zinc acetate ?/hich was 0.20 M with acetic 
acid. The third contained 3 ml. of 2 N sodium hydroxide. 

The exchange reaction was carried out by heating for two 

hours at 320-330°, thirty minutes at 330-340°,thirty 

o o 

minutes at 360 , and finally for fifteen minutes at 370-390 

The reaction mixture was steam distilled and the 

distillate was extracted with ether. The ether solution 

was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, then transferred 

to a Spath vacuum distillation bulb and the ether distilled 

off. The residue was vacuum distilled twice and crystallized 

from ethanol. This afforded 0.2446 g. (31$) of dibenzothio- 

o 

phene melting at 99 . The specific activity was 0.0141 
millicuries per mole. The dibenzothiophene was again twice 
vacuum distilled and recrystallized from ethanol yielding

material with a specific activity of 0.140 millicuries 
per mole. 

The evolved hydrogen sulfide which precipitated as 

zinc sulfide in the first and second bubblers was centrifuged 

and the centrifugate combined with the third bubbler. The 

resulting zinc sulfide was taken up in sodium hydroxide 

solution and chlorine was bubbled through to effect the 

12 

oxidation of sulfide to sulfate . The resulting solution 
was made very slightly acid with hydrochloric acid, boiled 
to expell excess chlorine and excess barium chloride 
solution was added slowly. The resulting precipitate of 
barium sulfate was digested, centrifuged, washed, transferred 
in alcohol suspension to a counting dish and the alcohol 
ecaporated under a heat lamp. The specific activity was 
approximately 0.00373 millicuries per mole. The weight 
of barium sulfate obtained was 0.0237 g. 

The contents of the third bubbler tube (combined with 
the centrifugate from the first two) were made basic with 
sodium hydroxide and chlorine was passed in as before. 

Barium sulfate was precipitated and counted in the same 
manner as already described for the sulfide precipitate. 

The specific activity of the barium sulfate was 0.000257 
millicuries per mole or 1.8$ of the specific activity of 
the original sulfur. Weight of barium sulfate was 0.7297 g.

Dibenzothiophene-5-oxide. The labelled dibenzothiophene 
was diluted with 0.4 g. of inactive material for convenience 
in handling and counting* Labelled dibenzothiophene (0*4364 
g. specific activity of 4*11 microcuries per mole) was 
dissolved in 7 g. of dry carbon tetrachloried and 0.217 g. 
of chlorine was added while the contents were kept at -5°C. 
Ice was then added to the flask and the whole was shaken 
thoroughly. The resulting pink solid was filtered off, 
recrystallized from benzene-heptane and yielded 0.373 g. 
melting at 175-180°. A second crop of 0.0234 g. gave a 
total yield of 83$. The specific activity of this 
product was 4.56 microcuries per mole. 

5-nitrodibenzothiophene-5-oxide. The above dibenzo- 

thiophene-5-oxide (0*3484 g.) was suspended in 2.84 ml. 

of an equal volume mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid 

o 

and acetic acid. The suspension was cooled to -5 and 
0.85 ml* of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.48) was added 
slowly and the resulting solution allowed to stand four 
hours at 0°. The solution was poured onto ice and the 
resulting solid was recrystallized from ethanol yielding 
0.304 g. (70$) of 3-nitrodibenzothiophene-5-oxide melting 
at 203-204°. The specific activity was 3.71 microcuries 
per mole.

stand overnight at room temperature. The free amine was 
liberated by adding sodium hydroxide solution till basic 
then extracting with ether. The ether solution was dried 
over anhydrous sodium sulfate then transferred to a Spath 
distillation bulb. The amine was distilled under high 
vacuum, yielding 0.1855 g. (91$). The amine was taken up 
in benzene, 0.15 ml. of acetic anhydride was added and the 
solution was refluxed for fifteen minutes. On cooling 
0.170 g. of 3-acetylaminodibenzothiophene separated. The 
specific activity was 4.18 microcuries per mole.

COLCHICINE LIKE COMPOUNDS 
Introduction 

Colchicine, a poisonous alkaloid extracted from 
Colchicum autumnale, the autumn crocus, has been shown 
to have several interesting physiological properties* 

The first use of colchicine was in the relief of gout, 
sometimes with dramatic results* It has also been shown'*' 
that the alkaloid, even in minute amounts, causes the 
arresting of cell division (mitosis) chiefly in the 
metaphase. It has been shown that it is impossible to 
inhibit mitosis of malignant cells with colchicine 
without simultaneously effecting the same action on 
other dividing cells of the organism; however, since 
the cells of a malignant tumor are undergoing division 
at a faster than normal rate, colchicine does show a 
greater damaging action to tumors than to normal tissue. 
Complete regression of some animal tumors has been in¬ 
duced by employing doses of the drug far in excess of 

those required to arrest mitosis, and just short of the 

2 

minimum lethal dose. The injury to tumors is chiefly 
the result of vascular damage to rapidly growing tumors 
since endothelial cells of nevily formed blood capillaries 
are particularly sensitive to mitotic poisoning”**.

Colchicine has also been used to produce monstrous 
chick embryos and double flowers in plants# In these 
cases the drug seems to interfere with mitotic processes, 
causing arrest of mitosis in the metaphase and abnormal 
numbers of chromosomes. 

The structure of colchicine was first partially 
established by Windaus as a phenanthrene derivative

corresponding to structure I. However, Cook and Barton,

dhinol methyl ether, that is 9,12,13,14-tetramethoxy- 
3,4,5,6-dibenz^l, 3,5-cycloheptatriene.

Another compound of recent interest is podophyllm 
which has been shown to produce severs gross damage in 
tumors apparently directly and indirectly with marked 
stasis and blood vessel damage. Tumor eells appeared 
to be arrested at vamous stages of mitosis.

Podophyllin has been separated into two fractions , 
podophyllotoxin and a compound designated as H.C.I.-1074, 
both of which possess tumor damaging properties down to 
3 micrograms per gram of body weight. Ormsbee and Gorman 
reported that crude podophyllin exerts a toxic effect 
against certain types of tumors. The effect on normal

mouse embryonic tissue is negligble at concentrations 
which cause extensive tumor cell damage. This 
differential toxic effect is more marked than that of 
any other known mitotic poison. 

There have been several structures proposed for 
podophyllotoxin. Borsche and Spath suggested formula V 
and Robertson^ proposed formula VI 



It was decided to attempt to prepare a series of 
compounds which would show structural similarities to 
both colchicine and podophyllotoxin* 

Assuming a seven membered B ring in colchicine 
(structure II), we can consider substituted 1,3-di- 
phenylpropylamines as being related to colchicine.

the methylenedioxy grouping in podophyllotoxin,

perhaps the most effective derivatives would be compounds 
corresponding to structures VII and VIII. 



The primary aim of Part II of this thesis was to 

prepare compounds VII and VIII which bear structural 

similarities to both colchicine and podophyllotoxin. 

Neither VII or VIII have been synthesized previously, 

11 

however, Christiansen prepared several other methoxyl 
substituted 1,3-diphenylpropylamines.

Discussion. 


The following flow sheet indicates the series of 
reactions used in the synthesis of one of the amines 
1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)- 
propylamine which was isolated as the picrate.

Two routes were used for conversion of the 
hydrochalcones to the corresponding amines. Route 
A, used by Christiansen*^, gave the same product as 
route B (the Leuckart react ion- 1 - 2 ) in the case of 
the simpler chalcones. Hov/ever, in the case of the

methylenedioxyhydrochalcones the products were not 
the same although carbon-hydorgen analysis in 
both cases agreed with percentages calculated for 
structure VII. 

None of the amines were obtained crystalline 
but remained as slightly colored viscous oils which 
readily formed crystalline picrates with picric 
acid in ethanol solution. In addition, amine VII 
was isolated from the Leuckart reaction as the 
hydrochloride salt. 

CHALCONES: The substituted chalcones were prepared 
by condensing equimolar amounts of aldehyde and 
ketone by means of sodium methoxide in methanol. 

The condensation occurred best in the cold and in 
most cases was almost quantitative, yielding easily 
purified yellow needles of the chalcone. The 
chalcone system of numbering is illustrated below. 



H YDBQCHALCONES : The hydrochaleones were prepared by 
the low pressure (50 p.s.i.) hydrogenation of the 
corresponding chalcones dissolved in ethyl acetate. 
Adams platinum oxide catalyst was used and in all 
cases the pressure drop corresponded to theoretical. 
When hydrogenation was complete (as indicated by 
the pressure drop and also the disappearance of 
the yellow color of the chalcone) the catalyst

was filtered off and the solvent distilled off 
under vacuum, leaving the white hydrochalcone in 
very good condition. Recrystallization was carried 
out from ethanol. 

03JMES : Oximation of the hydrochalcones was carried 
out by refluxing the hydrochalcone with a slight 
excess of hydroxyiamine hydrochloride in an equal 
volume mixture of pyridine and ethanol. After 
refluxing for about five hours, the reaction mixture 
was poured onto ice at which time the crude oxime 
solidified. Recrystallization was from ethanol. 

AMINES : The sodium-alcohol reduction of the oximes 

was carried out by the addition of small pieces 
of sodium to a refluxing solution of the oxime in 
anhydrous ethanol. When the addition of sodium 
was completed, the reaction was cooled, diluted 
with water and extracted immediately with benzene. 
The benzene extract was dried over anhydrous sodium 
carbonate and the benzene removed by room temperature 
distillation under vacuum, leaving the theoretical 
weight of light tan colored, uncrystallizable, 
viscous oil. 

Amines were also prepared by means of the 

Leuckart reaction employing ammonium formate or 

1p 12c• 

formamide • The mechanism postulated for the 

reaction is as follows:

With, excess of ammonium formate or formamide the 
product was usually the formylated amine. 

Ammonium formate-formamide reagent 13 and the 
hydrochalcone were heated together at 165-185 degrees 
for 3-5 hours during which time carbon dioxide, water 
and ammonia were slowly evolved. The thick oily 
product was then refluxed with concentrated hydrochloric 
acid for one to two hours to effect hyrolysis of the 
formyl derivative. It was found that the addition of 
a small amount of alcohol speeded up the hydrolysis 
and in some cases brought about the crystallization 
of the amine hydrochloride on cooling. In cases 
where the hydrochloride did not separate after 
refluxing, the solution was diluted, cooled, made 
basic with sodium hydroxide and extracted with benzene. 
On vacuum distilling the benzene, at room temperature, 
a tan colored uncrystallizable oil remained.

PICRATES : The oily amine was taken up in hot ethanol 
with a slight excess of picric acid added. On 
filtering and cooling the monopicrate usually separated 
out in good condition. An impure second crop of picrate 
could usually be obtained on dilution of the alcohol 
to about fifty percent. 

In the cases of l,3-di-(p-metho2yphenyl)-propyl¬ 
amine and l-phenyl-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-propyl- 
amine, the picrates obtained from the sodium reduction 
and from the Leuckart reaction were definitely the 
same* However, the picrates of amine VII prepared 
from both methods were not the same although 
carbon-hydrogen analysis checked* 

An interesting phenomenon occurred with 

l-phenyl-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine picrate• 

When crystallized from absolute or 95$ ethanol the 
o 

m.p. was 166-167 . When crystallized from dilute 
alcohol (50$) the m.p. was 127-129°, thus indicating 
different crystalline forms of the same substance 
depending on the crystallization solvent.

3.4- Dimethoxyhydrochalcone . Upon hydrogenation, the 
above ohalcone (21.8 g.) yielded 18 g. (82$) of re¬ 
crystallized hydrochalcone melting at 68-69*5°. 

3.4- Dimethoxyhydrochale one oxime . This oxime was 

prepared in the usual manner. Thirteen and one-half 

grams of hydrochalcone yielded 10*5 g. (74$) of re- 

o 

crystallized oxime melting at 108.5-109*5 . 

l-phenyl-5-(5 t 4-dime t ho2yphei3yl)-pro pylam ine picrate* 

A. From sodium reduction: Ten grams of oxime yielded 

10 grams of uncrystallizable oil. This oil when treated 
with an equal weight of picric acid in 100 ml. of ethanol, 
produced 13 g. of picrate melting about 150? Recrystal¬ 
lization when carried out by dilution of a hot ethanol 
solution to 50$ yielded 10.0 g. (57$), m.p* 126-126.5°. 
This material crystallized from 95$ ethanol yielded 
9.0 g. (51$) of picrate melting at 166.5-167.5°. The 
high melting material was readily converted to the 
low melting product merely by crystallization from 50$ 
ethanol* 

B. From the Leuckart reaction: The Leuckart reaction 
on 4.3 g. of 3,4-dimethoxyhydrochalcone yielded 7.0 g. 
(88$) of picrate melting at 124-127° when crystallized 
from dilute ethanol. The melting point was 166-167° 
from 95$ ethanol. Mixed melting points with material 
from the sodium reduction showed no depression.

1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-5-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-propyl¬ 

amine picrate. 

A* From sodium reduction : The oxime (10 g.) in 

anhydrous ethanol (250 ml*) was reduced by the addition 

of 20 g. of sodium in small pieces as already described* 

The tan colored oil so produced showed no tendency 

to crystallize so the picrate was made (9*0 g*, 59$) 

o 

melting at 155-156 when crystallized from dilute 
alcohol, 

B* From the Leuckart reaction : The hydrochalcone 
(8.0 g,) was reacted with Ingersoll f s formate-formamide 
reagent as described previously. After hydrolysis with 
hydrochloric acid the acid solution was steam 
distilled, then made basic to liberate the amine 
and steam distilled. However, no product distilled 
over and the odor of ammonia was evident so the 
steam distillation was stopped and the residue was 
extracted with benzene. An oil was obtained which 
yielded 6.5 g. (37$) of picrate melting at 157-158° 
when crystallized from dilute ehtanol. 

There was no depression of melting point when 
mixed with the picrate from the corresponding sodium 
reduction.

1-(4-Met hozy phenyl)-5-(5,4,5-trimeth oxyphenyl)- 

propylamine picrate. 

A. From sodium reduction : The oxime (8.5 g.) was 
reduced with sodium in ethanol and yielded 8.5 g. of 
tan colored oil. This oil produced 6.0 g. of picrate 
melting up to 190°. Recrystaliization from ethanol 
yielded 5.1 g. (37$) melting at 188-190° and re¬ 
solidifying about 195°. Further purification raised 
the melting point to 193°.

SUMMARY 

Some derivatives of 1,3-diphenylpropyl-amine 
have been synthesized for their possible value as 
cancer destroying compounds• These compounds may 
be considered as combined analogues of colchicine 
and podophyllotoxin. These compounds are: 

1,(2,5,4-trimethoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedio2yphenyl)- 
propylamine picrate, 1, (3,4,5-trimethoxy phenyl)- 

3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-propylamine picrate and 
the corresponding hydrochloride derivative. 

In addition, the Leuckart reaction has been 
investigated with regards to its use in preparation 
of the above amines as well as the following compounds: 

1,3-di-(4-methoxyphenyl)-propylamine, 

1-phenyl-3-(3,4-dimethoxy phenyl)-propylamine, 

It( 4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine 9 
l-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-propylamine. 

In some cases the Leuckart reaction gave the 
desired amines, in other cases the products seemed to 
be isomeric amines of a yet unknown nature.
