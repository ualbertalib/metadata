SYNOPSIS 


The dispersing action of several reagents with which 
oat protein may be extracted, was investigated# Sodium ben¬ 
zoate and sodium salicylate extracted high amounts of protein, 
but the protein u fractions n would not redisperse in the con¬ 
centration of dispersing agent from which they were originally 
obtained# These agents appear to alter the protein, possibly 
by forming salt linkages between the side chains# 

The physical characteristics of precipitated oat 
protein differ from those of wheat gluten# Oat protein does 
not possess cohesive or elastic properties# 

The electrophoretic patterns of whole oat extract 
in formic acid-sodium formate buffer show the presence of 
four components - one major component migrating at a high 
rate while the other major component does not migrate# It has 
been concluded that this stationary component, which is also 
non-dialysable and therefore of macromolecular size, is pro¬ 
bably non-protein in nature - possible a polysaccharide, 
although this was not investigated# 

Diffusion constants were determined for whole oat 
extract, and for a protein precipitate obtained at pH 6*3# A 
higher diffusion constant was obtained for the whole oat extract 
than for the precipitate# This difference means that the

non-precipitated material has a much greater diffusion rate 
than has the protein that can be precipitated at pH 6*3, and 
is therefore probably made up of definitely smaller molecular 
units* T he whole oat extract is, as would be expected, poly- 
disperse* The precipitated protein is also polydispersej 
this does not necessarily prove the presence of different pro¬ 
tein species* The turbidity of most dispersions indicates 
aggregation of part of the protein* Such aggregates would 
cause the diffusion curves to be statistically non-normal. 

Wheat gluten was dispersed in formic acid, and gave 
electrophoretic results quite different from those obtained with 
gluten dispersed in sodium salicylate* 

It is concluded that sodium salicylate and sodium 
benzoate are unsatisfactory dispersing agents if electrostatic 
properties of proteins are to be investigated*

PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS ON OAT PROTEIN, 
USING PHYSICO-CHEMICAL METHODS 


P® Melnychyn 


INTRODUCTION 


This thesis deals with a preliminary investigation 
of oat protein using physico-chemical methods* So far as the 
writer is aware, there are no published data on oat protein 
using these methods© Sine© little work has been done on oat 
proteins, and since the approach to this study was based on 
work done on other cereal proteins, the literature review is 
concerned with the cereal proteins, the term tl cereal" being 
restricted to wheat, rye, oats and barley© As the greatest 
abundance of literature is concerned v/ith gluten from wheat, 
this is reviewed more fully than the other cereal proteins©

REVIEW OP LITERATURE 


The literature on the fundamental studies of cereal 
proteins is less extensive than the literature on the study of 
proteins from animal sources© This is principally due to the 
lack of suitable extraction techniques and the difficulties 
encountered in getting the protein into solution© The common 
dispersing agents such as acetate, phosphate and barbiturate 
buffers, as used in the study of animal proteins, have not 
been found suitable when applied to cereal proteins© This is 
due to the low solubility of the protein in these agents© 


Wheat Protein 


Early investigations on gluten dispersion have been 
very well reviewed by Bailey (5)© It has generally been con¬ 
ceded that early research on wheat protein was started by 
Beccari in 1728 (5, page 113* when he separated gluten from 
flour by washing a dough with water© This technique has since 
■been only slightly modified by Dill and Alsberg (14) and 1 % 
phosphate buffer stream, at pH 6©8 is now used©

Ih attempts to characterize the protein, ^inhof (5, 
page 12) studied the solubility of gluten in alcohol. Soon 
after, Taddei (5, page 12) separated gluten into two fractions* 
He regarded the alcohol soluble portion as gliadine and the 
remaining residue as zimome* 

Since this early work in the 18th century, much con¬ 
fusion existed as to the exact composition of gluten - whether 
it was a single protein complex or a group of separate protein 
entities, together forming gluten* Alcohol extraction studies 
by Ritthausen (5, page 18) indicated that it was possible to 
obtain several protein components differing slightly, or not 
at all, from one another* 

Following Osborne ! s research in 1907 (38), the compo¬ 
nents of the gluten protein appeared to be well established* 

H e regarded gluten as being composed of two proteins, glutenin 
and gliadin* 

Interest in gluten research was again revived in the 
late 1920*s* Tague (48) studied gliadin solubility in different 
acid solvents* He observed no clear-cut solubility as is 
encountered in simple salts, but the solubility varied with the 
ratio of gliadin to solvent* 

In 1931, Herd (18) conducted investigations on gluten 
dispersion following a pre-extraction procedure using dilute 
saline solution* He observed that the proportion of the total 




- 4 - 


protein appearing in an alcoholic extract depended on the 
nature and the concentration of the saline solution first em¬ 
ployed* He suggested that gliadin was not a distinct component* 
Studying peptization of the flour proteins, Sinclair 
and Gortner (46) observed that gliadin preparations made by 
recovery from alcohol extracts would not completely redissolve 
in alcohol solutions after the protein had been dried* This 
suggests some alteration in the make-up of the molecule* 

The fact that these differences in the co rip o sit ion of 
gluten did exist suggested that further investigations on crude 
gluten were still required* Cook and Alsberg (10) and Cook and 
Rose (11) proved that wet crude gluten washed from wheat flour 
is capable of being completely dispersed in urea and sodium 
salicylate solutions* Hopkins (20) found urea to exert a de¬ 
naturing effect as well as a dispersive action on gluten* H© 
postulated that the denaturation effect appeared to be related 
to chemical configuration* Anson and Mirsky (5) found that 
urea and sodium salicylate altered or denatured albumin* 

Hater (4) these workers found that the viscosity was very sen¬ 
sitive to slight changes in salt and hydrogen ion concentration* 

In 1935 Rose and Cook (43) conducted an. investigation 
into the viscosity of gluten dispersed in these two neutral 
solvents as well as the classical solvents, dilute acid and alkali*

Based on viscosity measurements these workers concluded that 
the effective particle size is larger in urea and sodium sali¬ 
cylate solutions# The character of the precipitate obtained 
on salting out the dispersions in each of the four solvents 
indicated that the neutral solvents altered the gluten less 
than did acid or alkali# T his conclusion was further sub¬ 
stantiated by the fact that flours of different quality had 
essentially the same viscosity when dispersed in dilute acid 
or alkali, whereas dispersions in the neutral solvents showed 
a variation in viscosity. 

Cook and Rose (11) and McCalla and Rose (36) studied 
gluten dispersal in varying concentrations of sodium salicylate# 
It was observed that gluten was completely dispersed in 8$ so¬ 
dium salicylate and in 24$ urea (11)# However, sodium sali¬ 
cylate offers two advantages over urea as a neutral solvent# 

It does not contain nitrogen and can be used in lower con¬ 
centrations© 

McCalla and Rose (36) studied gluten fractionation by 
the addition of magnesium sulfate# They found that the amid© 
nitrogen increased with the percentage of the protein preci¬ 
pitated until 80$ of the protein was precipitated, then the 
percentage of amide nitrogen decreased sharply# Conversely, 
the arginine nitrogen tended to decrease and then increase#

This suggested that the most soluble fraction differs from the 
remainder® Prom these investigations, these workers challen¬ 
ged the earlier concept that gluten consisted of two proteins 
but postulated that gluten consists of a single protein complex 
which may be separated into a great many fractions which dif¬ 
fer progressively and systematically in both physical and chem¬ 
ical properties® 

Spencer and McCalla (47) extended this investigation 
by employing fractional solubility methods, using a stock 
dispersion of gluten in 8$ sodium salicylate and separating 
various fractions by dilution® Except for the most soluble 
15$, gluten protein appeared to consist of a complex that could 
be progressively fractionated® 

Kuhlmann (26) concluded that gluten is a natural high 
polymer representing a complex of proteins, forming micelles 
of various lengths® He also illustrated that the longest and 
most stable micelles are those of glutenin while gliadin con¬ 
sists of shorter micelles, less stable, and more flocculent® In 
conducting gluten dispersion studies in varying alcohol con¬ 
centrations, he observed that in alcohol concentrations up to 
30$, the gluten retained its cohesive properties and changed 
only slightly in external appearance® Maximum peptization was 
evidenced at 40$ alcohol concentration whether extractions were

conducted on the same sample with increasing alcohol con¬ 
centrations, or different samples of gluten were used for the 
different alcohol concentrations® However, the types of pep¬ 
tization curves were different, showing a rapid decrease in 
peptization with increasing alcohol concentrations on the same 
sample. This was explained by the presence, in gluten, of a 
less highly aggregated and more easily peptizable fraction whose 
maximum solubility is reached at 40$ alcohol concentration. 

This fraction, through interaction with a more highly aggre¬ 
gated and less soluble fraction of gluten, acts as a peptizer 
of the latter by means of adsorption, ^t also conditions the 
stability of the sol formed. 

Using microelectrophoretie techniques, K©mp (21) and 
Kemp and Rideal (22) have studied the surface behaviors of 

glutenin and gliadin by adsorption of these proteins on quarts 

particles. An increase in ionic strength of dispersing agent 
lowers the isoelectric point of glutenin. At infinite dilution 
Kemp regards the isoelectric point of glutenin to be at pH 

4.90. Kemp has also observed that if gliadin stands in 70$ 

alcohol, the alcohol promotes denaturation by favoring the dis*» 
appearance of the basic groups* 

Haugaard and Johnson (17) presented evidence that glia¬ 
din does not behave as a simple homogeneous protein. Krejci and 
Svedberg (25) conducted an ultracentrifugal study on gliadin* 
They observed the sedimentation constant, converted to water at 




- s 


O -13 

20 , was 2*10 x 10 , These lighter molecules were in greatest 

abundance but heavier particles were also present* Gliadin was 
stable over a wide pH range* B e yond pH 12 there was a drop in 
the sedimentation constant accompanied by a decrease in light 
absorption and the disappearance of heavy molecules* Thermal 
fractionation of gliadin by the method of Haugaard and Johnson 
(17) led these workers to conclude that gliadin was not a simple 
homogeneous prote5.no The least soluble fractions had a higher 
proportion of heavy molecules while the most soluble fraction 
consisted almost entirely of the constituent of lowest mole¬ 
cular weighto 

Ultracentrifugal investigations on salt extracts of 
proteins of wheat flour, using 0»5N solutions of potassium halides, 
were conducted by Krejci and Svedberg (24)« These workers con¬ 
cluded that KF, KOI, KBr and KI, in this order, extract mixtures 
of proteins of increasing average molecular weights* 

In an electrophoretic study of gliadin in acetate 
buffers of varying ionic strengths and hydrogen ion cencentrations 
Schwert, Putnam and Briggs (45) concluded that gliadin is not 
an electrophoretically homogeneous protein* Under conditions 
where it was possible to obtain the protein in solution there 
was definite evidence of component interaction* ^hese workers 
concluded that the interaction between components was not, or at 
least not completely^ an ionic interaction*

McCalla and Gralen (35) studied the molecular character¬ 
istics of gluten in sodium salicylate solutions by means of 
sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium and diffusion 
measurementso They observed an increase in the proportion of 
molecularly dispersed gluten with an increase in sodium sal¬ 
icylate concentration, but the dispersed portions had essentially 
the same sedimentation constant regardless of the concentration 
of the dispersing medium® 

The most soluble gluten fraction, although molecularly 
dispersed, was not homogeneous• ^he weight average molecular 
weight of this fraction was 44,000 but it was suggested that 
the lower limit of molecular weight may be about 35,000® 

These workers (35) concluded that their results support 
the hypothesis that gluten is a protein system showing progre¬ 
ssive and regular changes in properties with changes in solu¬ 
bility® 

Electrophoretic diagrams of gluten in sodium sali¬ 
cylate solutions were obtained by Colvin and McCalla (9)® The 
diagrams indicated that gluten in sodium salicylate was ele¬ 
ctrostatically homogeneous with a high mean negative valence and 
possessing a high surface charge density® This, together with 
the observation that the isoelectric point of gluten in sodium 
salicylate was somewhere below pH 4®0, suggested that the low 
value of the isoelectric point and the high negative valence

were due to a selective adsorption of salicylate ions by the 
protein particles* Similar observations have been recorded 
in a shift of the isoelectric point by the adsorption of pic- 
rate ions on silk fibroin (1, page 27)* Wood and Hardy (50) 
have shown that the physical properties of gluten v are a fun¬ 
ction of the electric charge on the gluten micelles, which in 
turn depended on the hydrogen ion concentration of the surround¬ 
ing medium* 

Laws and France (29) conducted an investigation of 
protein fractions of flour from various wheats in 50$ alcoholic 
buffer, alkaline buffers at pH 10*2 and dispersions in acetic 
acid dialysed against citric acid-disodium phosphate buffer at 
pH 2*15* They did not observe any significant differences in 
the flour proteins* Electrophoresis of water extracts of var¬ 
ious flours all produced similar electrophoretic patterns* 


Rye Protein 


An excellent historical review of the prolamines of 
cereals is presented by Hoffman and G ortner (19)* This class of 
proteins has been defined as those soluble in 60 - 80$ alcohol* 
They are water-insoluble and soluble in dilute acids and alkali*

On hydrolysis, they yield much glutamic acid, proline and 
ammonia, and little or no lysine• 

In addition to preparing an alcohol-soluble extract 
from wheat, Einhof (19, page 214) extracted an alcohol soluble 
material from rye# Ritthausen (19, page 214) described three 
proteins from rye: - albumin, "raucedin" (alcohol soluble) 
and "gluten casein 11 e He considered "mucedin" to be similar to 
the mucedin he thought present in wheat# Osborne (19, page 215) 
prepared gliadin from rye using the same method as used in pre¬ 
paring gliadin from wheat# He regarded the products as identical# 
Luers (19, page 215) found that the colloid chemical properties of 
gliadin from both cereals are identical# Contradictory evidence 
was presented by G-roh and. Priedl (19, page 215) who were unable to 
isolate a preparation from rye identical with that from wheat# 

The diffusion constant of secalin was determined by 
Andrews (2) as 4#78 x 10 $ when converted to water at 25 C# 

This value compares favorably with the values of diffusion con¬ 
stants for gliadin and hordein# His method of calculating the 
molecular weight of secalin is open to question# Using the 
sedimentation constant for gliadin the molecular weight was 
around 40,000# 

Cunningham and Anderson (12) have prepared a "gluten 1 * 
•from both barley and rye flour# They found that these products, 
as compared with wheat gluten, are tougher, less elastic, co¬ 
hesive and sticky#

Oat Protein 


Norton (19, page 216) observed that it was not possible 
to prepare a coherent gluten when oat flour is kneaded with 
water* The preparation and properties of gliadin from oats 
have been studied by Kreusler and Osborne (19, page 216)« They 
found difficulty in preparing uniform samples of this protein* 
They concluded that the protein apparently undergoes some change 
when in contact with water or weak salt solutions, as this 
secondary 11 protein possesses a different composition* This 
conclusion was substantiated by Luers and Siegert (19, page 217), 
the change being especially noted in the cystine, ammonia and 
arginine * 

Hoffman and Gortner (19) suggest naming the alcohol*® 
soluble extract in oats as sativin* 

Cunningham and Anderson (12) have been unable to pre¬ 
pare a "gluten 1 * from oat flour similar to the glutens prepared 
from barley and rye* Oat flour has yielded only a clay-like 
product with no elastic properties*

Barley Protein 


The name "hordein 1 * as given to the alcohol soluble 
extract from barley, was first suggested by Proust (19, page 
217 ) 0 The method of preparing this protein is similar to the 
procedure as used in preparing gliadin from wheat gluten* A 
common method of preparing the prolamines from cereals is sugge¬ 
sted by Hoffman and G-ortner (19, page 245)* 

McCalla (34) reports that Quensel and Svedberg have 
conducted investigations on hordein and have found it to be a 
heterogeneous protein* 

Cunningham and Anderson (12) have prepared ! *gluten 1 * 
from barley flour* They found that the gluten is less elastic, 
tougher, more cohesive, and sticky, than gluten from wheat flour*

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


A supply of oats of the variety Ajax, Certified No. 2, 
was obtained from the Alberta Seed Growers© The majority of 
the oat hulls were removed by milling# Very little of the hull 
was fine enough to pass with the oat flour through a 10XX screen. 
Ether extracted oat flotir was used in all investigations. 

The ether extracted flour contained 23.25 mgm. nitrogen 
per gram of flour, based on oven dry weight# Nitrogen content 
was determined by the Kjeldahl method using mercuric oxide as 
catalyst© T he ash content of the flour, based on oven dry 
weight, was 1#21 

All solutions used in the studies on oat protein were 
prepared from C©P# reagent chemicals# 

One general method of extracting the oat protein was 
followed# Duplicate 2-gram samples of oat flour were weighed 
into cellulose nitrate centrifuge tubes* At the time of weigh¬ 
ing, several sanples were used for moisture determination, thus 
making it possible to calculate the amount of nitrogen ex¬ 
tracted on an oven-dry basis© Fifty cc# of dispersing agent 
was added to each of the tubes# Th.e contents were stirred 
occassionally to keep the oat flour in suspension. After 90 




- 15 - 


minutes extraction time, the tubes and contents were centri¬ 
fuged in an angle centrifuge for 20 minutes at 4000 r«p*m* It 
was found that some of the supernatant liquid still contained 
particles of flour making it necessary to filter the samples• 

In order to follow the same technique, this procedure was 
employed for all the oat extracts* Aliquots of 10 cc» were 
used for determining the nitrogen in the filtrate<> ^t was 
then possible to determine the total amount of nitrogen ex¬ 
tracted* 

Solutions of sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate used 
for electrophoresis were unbuffered salts* Since the patterns 
produced in the ascending and descending limbs were similar 
and no pH changes were experienced in the limbs during the time 
of electrophoresis, it was considered that no additional buffer¬ 
ing was necessary* Oat extracts in 0*1N formic acid had to be 
buffered (49)* This was done by the addition of sodium formate 
to make the solution 0.05N with respect to sodium formate* 

Even this amount of sodium formate did. not result in the 
production of like patterns in the ascending and descending 
limbs (see Pi go 9) but this was taken as the arbitrary tipper 
limit since a solution of 0*1N formic acid made 0*1N with res¬ 
pect to sodium formate caused precipitation of the protein in 
the oat extract* 

The Tiselius electrophoresis apparatus as described 
in several papers (1, 30, 31, 32, 33) was used for the

physico-chemical study of the protein extracts and dispersions# 
Both stationary and mechanical stirring (42) dialysis techniques 
were employed 0 All electrophoresis determinations* unless 
otherwise noted, were made at 2*0 t 0 o 05°C# An. industrial 
instrument conductivity bridge, model RC-1, was used for 
measurement of the resistance and electrical conductivity of 
the solutions employed* A Beckman Model G glass electrode pH 
meter was used for measuring the pH of the solutions. 

Diffusion determinations were made at 20 - 0*05°C* 
using Tiselius electrophoretic equipment* ^he Tiselius cell 
was used owing to the difficulties involved in making a leak- 
proof seal with the Neurath diffusion cell (37)® An Ostwald 
viscometer, calibrated against water, was used for measuring 
the viscosity of the solutions, following the procedure out¬ 
lined by Findlay (15)®

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


A* Extraction of Oat Nitrogen 


In order to study the properties of any protein, it 
is first necessary to select a dispersing agent, which in 
low concentrations extracts the maximum amount of protein and 
still has a minimum hydrolytic and denaturing effect on the 
protein* Several possible dispersing agents were selected* 

Most of these have been used in connection with studies on 
other plant proteins* 

Early preliminary results, not recorded in this thesis, 
showed that the maximum nitrogen extracted, using 0«5 Molal 
sodium salicylate, was obtained after 90 minutes extraction 
time* Consequently In an effort to keep conditions constant, 
the results of this experiment, presented in Table 1, were 
obtained after 90 minutes extraction* 

These results show that the neutral salts - sodium 
formate, sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate - at similar 
concentrations and pH values differ in ability to disperse the 
oat protein* Sodium formate is the poorest dispersing agent 
of the three*

Formic acid, 0.01N, extracts no more nitrogen than 
does distilled water, indicating that only the water-soluble 
protein, which comprises about 11$ of the total protein is 
extracted* However, formic acid at a higher concentration has 
much greater dispersing power* 

The amount of alcohol-extractable nitrogen from oat 
flour is only 21$o This is considerably lower than the amount 
extracted from wheat gluten* Larmour and SalIans (28) deter¬ 
mined that about 75$ of wheat gluten is soluble in aqueous al¬ 
cohol* These workers regard two-thirds of the alcohol soluble 
fraction as gliadin and the remainder as a u me sonin’ 1 fraction* 
This difference in the amounts of prolamine in the two cereals 
may have a significant bearing on the differences in the physical 
properties of the two proteins*

in Pig* 1* Sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate act similarly 
in dispersing oat protein, except that sodium salicylate ex¬ 
tracts larger amounts* Maximum dispersal was obtained in 
concentrations of 0*3 Molal solutions* dispersions of protein 
in higher salt concentrations of sodium salicylate were very 
viscous and presented a problem in filtering* Sodium benzoate 
dispersions were not so viscous* T he residues from the higher 
concentrations of sodium salicylate swelled considerably* This 
is probably due to the swelling of starch granules* 

On storing the dispersions overnight at 5°C* some 
protein precipitate appeared in 0*1 Molal sodium benzoate and 
sodium salicylate solutions* On trying to recover these pre¬ 
cipitates for electrophoretic analysis, it was found that they 
would not redisperse in the same concentration of dispersing 
agent in which they were originally obtained, but that they would 
redisperse in a higher concentration of dispersing agent* ^he 
same problem was encountered when protein, dispersions in sodium 
salicylate were dialysed against water* The precipitate that 
formed would not redisperse in the original medium* These 
observations indicate that the protein must have undergone some 
changes in these neutral salts or on precipitation* What these 
changes were has not been determined, but it is possible that 
intramolecular salt links between side chains are formed, and

that these are not easily disrupted 0 Butler (39, page 152) 
reports that breakdown products of dried insulin would not 
redisperse in the medium from which they were originally pre¬ 
cipitated. H© regards this as possibly due to the formation 
of intramolecular salt links between side chains, which were 

m 

previously separated by water. A he removal or partial re¬ 
moval of water from insulin may cause disorientation from 
which the protein recovers only slowly. 


2. Effects of Ratio of Oat Flour to Dispersing Agent 

This experiment was designed to determine whether the 
ratio of oat flour to dispersing agent had any effect on the am¬ 
ount of nitrogen extracted and whether the amount of precipi- 

o 

tate formed on storing the dispersions for 12 hours at 5 C. was 
a constant for the various ratios. The results are given in 
Table 2. 

These results indicate that higher amounts of ni¬ 
trogen are dispersed when a larger volume of dispersing agent 
is used. Tt seems possible that the action of sodium sali¬ 
cylate is that of selective adsorption of salicylate ions on the 
protein, as earlier postulated by Colvin and McCaila (9), or of 
protein-ion complex formation discussed by Klot z (23)®

persions* The lower value for the 1:5 ratio is a reflection of 
the poor dispersion effected#

3o Effects of Varying pH of Neutral Salts on the Extraction of 
Oat Nitrogen 

Sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate solutions, at 
0*3 Molal concentration were adjusted in pH by adding sodium 
hydroxide or hydrochloric acid# The results of this experiment 
are shown in Fig# 2# 

The behaviour of these salts is similar, as similar 
extraction curves are obtained# Again, as in Fig# 1, sodium 
salicylate shows the greater dispersing power# Hydrogen-ion 
concentration does not affect the dispersing ability of sodium 
salicylate from pH 5#5 to pH 9 as the same amount of nitrogen 
is extracted over this pH range# The dispersing ability of 
sodium benzoate may be slightly affected however, as there is 
a tendency for more nitrogen to be extracted with increased pH# 
The lower pH values are near the pH at which these 
salts precipitate as slightly soluble acids# This probably 
accounts for the lower amount of nitrogen dispersed# 

The observations that the protein that precipitated 
from sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate solutions would not 
redisperse in the same concentration of dispersing agent from 
which it was originally obtained, raised a doubt as to the 
value of using these dispersing agents in an electrophoretic

study of oat protein. As it is not definitely known how the 
protein is affected by these reagents, only limited studies 
were made (see section D). 


C. Oat Protein in Formic Acid 


Since sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate were not 
regarded as particularly suitable dispersing agents in which 
to study oat protein, formic acid dispersions were used for 
further investigations, disregarding the alkaline dispersing 
agents, it can be seen from Table 1 that the only other me¬ 
dium which extracts reasonably high amounts of nitrogen is 
0.IN formic acid. Cunningham and Anderson (12) have reported 
using this reagent in studying oat protein, but the details 
of their procedure has not been published® 


1o The Effect of lime on the Extraction of Oat Nitrogen 

Dispersions of oat nitrogen in 0.1N formic acid were 
very turbid. Since 90 minutes was used as the extraction time.

it was hoped that if shorter times of extraction could be 
employed, the turbidity of the extract would be decreased# 
The procedure outlined in the section on Materials and 
Methods was used in this experiment, except that the ratio 
of oat flour to dispersing agent was 1:12#5# ^he results

These results show that the amount of oat nitrogen 
extracted after 15 minutes extraction time was the same as ob¬ 
tained after 90 minutes extraction time® By visual observation 
it was not possible to observe differences in turbidity - all 
the dispersions were very turbid® This would be expected if the 
turbidity is caused by the aggregation of some of the protein* 

If the turbidity is due to the presence of swollen starch gra¬ 
nules, an increase in turbidity would be expected with increas¬ 
ing time of extraction* 

A comparison of the results in Table 1 and Table 3 
show that 1:25 and 1:12*5 ratios of flour to solvent result in 
comparable extraction of protein* 


2 0 Precipitation of Oat Protein from Formic Acid Dispersions 


(a) Use of saturated magnesium sulfate solution 

A stock dispersion of oat protein in 0*1N formic 
acid was prepared* To 25 cc© aliquots, varying volumes of 
saturated magnesium sulfate solution were added, to give the 
desired level of saturation* The solutions were allowed to

20 minutes* The nitrogen content of the supernatant liquid 
was determined. It was then possible to determine the amount 
of nitrogen in the precipitate indirectly since a record was 
kept of the total volumes# No attempt was made to remove pro¬ 
tein "fractions 1 * from a single aliquot by repeated increases 
in the degree of saturation# ^he results of this experiment 
are shown in Fig* 3# 

A similar technique was used by McCalla and Rose (36) 
in gluten investigations# They observed that about 90$ of the 
gluten in 8$ sodium salicylate was precipitated at 0#2 saturation 
with respect to magnesium sulfate# On increasing the saturation 
to 0*5, only a slight additional amount of gluten was precipi¬ 
tated# 

The precipitates that were formed at the different 
degrees of saturation in the present experiment appeared to be 
similar in physical characteristics# Tk©y were white, curdy 
and possessed no elastic properties# These precipitates would 
not redisperse in 0#1N formic acid# Tfri s was probably due to 
the presence of magnesium sulfate# No attempt was made to 
dialyse the precipitates free of this salt and then observe 
whether they would redisperse.

Fig, 3# ^he effect of saturation with res¬

precipitation of oat protein from 
dispersions in 0.1N formic acid* 










- 31 - 


As shown in Fig # 3 # the precipitation curve was 
continuous over the satiiration range that was studied, but 
there appeared to be some progressive falling off in the am¬ 
ount of protein precipitated as the concentration of magne¬ 
sium sulfate was increased* Even at half saturation only 76$ 
of the protein in the extract was precipitated# Comparing the 
hehaviour of magnesium sulfate on oat and gluten protein, the 
action appears to be quite different# Cat protein requires not 
only a higher degree of saturation but even then less protein 
is precipitated# Two explanations may be offered to explain 
these observations# First, the difference may be attributed 
to the different character of the proteins themselves, and 
secondly to the differences in dispersing agents# Ihe gluten 
was dispersed in 8$ sodium salicylate while oat protein was 
dispersed in 0#1N formic acid# If the dispersing power of 
salicylate depends on adsorption or reaction of salicylate 
ions with the protein, then magnesium sulfate must overcome 
this effect# Ihe dispersing action of formic acid is pro¬ 
bably quite different*

(b) Use of saturated calcium hydroxide solution 

This experiment was designed to determine the effect 
of calcium hydroxide on the precipitation of oat protein from 
formic acid# This reagent has been used by Cunningham and 
Anderson (12)# The procedure followed was similar to that 
described for magnesium sulfate precipitation* The results 
are shown in Pig# 4# 

As shown in Pig* 4, the precipitation curve was 
continuous over the pH range that was studied, but there appeared 
to be some progressive falling off in the amount of protein 
precipitated as the pH levels are increased# However the amount 
of precipitation occurring was smaller than obtained in salt¬ 
ing out with magnesium sulfate solution# At pH 6*5 only 
about 46% of the extracted protein is precipitated* This makes 
a total of 70% of the total protein that is precipitated at half 
saturation at pH 6#5# This value is somewhat lower than is 
obtained at half saturation without neutralization# As only 
one determination was made at this pH, too great emphasis should 
not be placed on this value# is possible that the 6% dif¬ 
ference may be due to experimental error# 

The precipitates that were obtained appeared to be 
similar to those obtained by precipitating with magnesium sul¬ 
fate# The precipitates would not redisperse in 0*1U formic

acid* This may be due to the selective adsorption of calcium 
ions which in some combinations are relatively low in solu¬ 
bility* If the precipitates had been dialysed against water 
they might have redispersed, but since the protein is not 
completely precipitated, even at pH 6*5, the study was not 
carried further* 


(c) Use of 0*1N sodium hydroxide solution 

The first attempts at fractionating oat protein 
were made by adding 0*1N sodium hydroxide until the lowest 
desired pH was obtained* The precipitate that formed was 
removed by centrifuging* Then an additional quantity of sod¬ 
ium hydroxide was added to the supernatant liquid to reach 
the next pH level* The additional amount of protein that 
precipitated was neglibigle* Another method was then fol¬ 
lowed* The protein extract was repeatedly dialysed against 
formic acid-sodium hydroxide solutions of progressively higher 
pH* Again the additional amount of protein that precipitated 
was negligible* Finally it was necessary to adopt the same 
technique as used in the precipitation studies with saturated 
magnesium sulfate solution and neutralization with calcium 
hydroxide•

The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 5 . 
These results show that there is a progressive increase in the 
amount of precipitate formed, until a maximum is reached. The 
other methods of fractionation did not give this maximum. 

Maximum precipitation occurs at approximately pH 6 to 7, 

At pH 8.1 and 10 o 7 smaller amounts of protein were precipit¬ 
ated. This is almost certainly due to the dispersing action 
of sodium hydroxide itself. 

The precipitates were similar in character to those 
obtained on saturation with magnesium sulfate and neutraliza¬ 
tion with calcium hydroxide. 

The supernatant liquid from which the precipitates 
were removed, was clear except for those solutions at the 
lowest pH 0 

At maximum, only about 70$ of the total protein in 
the dispersion could be precipitated by this method, These 
precipitates redispersed slowly in 0.1N formic acid. The 
resulting solution was very turbid* This is probably due to 
aggregation of the protein, as turbidity is characteristic of 
gluten dispersions containing aggregates of relatively large 
size (35). Even when very small amounts of protein were disper¬ 
sed in relatively large volumes of formic acid, the resulting 
solution was still turbid.

Since thesp were the only precipitates that would 
redisperse in 0.1N formic acid, a modification of this method 
was adopted in obtaining protein "fractions’ 1 used for electro¬ 
phoretic determinations® 


D« Electrophoresis Experiments 


1. Whole Oat Protein Extract 

At the start of the electrophoretic determinations 
it was thought advisable to determine the type of electropho¬ 
retic patterns obtained for unfractionated oat protein in 
different dispersing agents* Solutions of 0.3 Molal sodium ben¬ 
zoate, 0.3 Molal sodium salicylate, 0.2M boric acid-potassium 
chloride-sodium hydroxide and 0*1N formic acid-0.05N sodium 
formate were used. The patterns for the whole extracts are 
shown in Pigs. 6, 7, 8 and 9. It should be noted that ex¬ 
tracts in sodium benzoate, sodium salicylate and formic acid- 
sodium formate do not represent complete extraction of the 
oat protein.

Oat protein in each of sodium benzoate, sodium sali¬

tions was negatively charged* 0 n e component appears to make 
up most of the protein in each of these dispersing agents* 

Sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate patterns indicate the pre¬ 
sence of one and possibly two smaller components* ^he electro¬ 
phoretic pattern of oat protein in boric acid-potassium chloride- 
sodium hydroxide solutions shown in Fig c 7 was obtained at pH 
11*8* At this pH, since it is so far on the alkaline side 
of the isoelectric point of the protein, it wotild be expected 
that the protein would be completely negatively charged and that 
it might not be resolved into components* 

Oat protein in formic acid-sodium formate solution 
was positively charged* The oat extract was resolved into four 
components* One principal component has a very high mobility 
and the other principal component does not migrate* This non¬ 
migrating component was investigated more fully and is dis¬ 
cussed in the following section*

sodium hydroxide# ^he modification consisted of dialysing ali¬ 
quots of the protein extract against solutions of formic acid- 
sodium hydroxide at different pH levels# The dialysis was 
carried on for 48 hours and the dialysing solution was changed 
twice, at 24 hour intervals# The protein precipitate was cen¬ 
trifuged and washed twice with relatively large volumes of 
solution of the same pH against which the protein extract was 
earlier dialysed# 

The protein was redispersed in 0#1N formic acid and then 
dialysed against 0*1N formic acid-0 o 05N sodium formate solu¬ 
tion# *^he dispersions were very turbid, indicating that the 
protein is probably highly aggregated# The solutions were so 
turbid that it was necessary to centrifuge them before using 
them for electrophoresis, otherwise the pattern could not be 
recorded on photographic plates# The small amount of protein 
thrown down by the centrifuge reduced turbidity so that a 
photographic record could be made# The electrophoretic patterns 
of the “fractions” are shown in Fig. 10# The electrophoretic 
pattern of the precipitate obtained by adjusting the dispersion 
of the whole extract to pH 4,0 does not differ essentially from 
the pattern of the precipitate obtained by adjusting the pH 
to 7 o 5 #

A large proportion of the precipitated protein appears 
to be electrophoretically homogeneous, regardless of the 
proportion precipitated* 

The mobility of the rapidly migrating component was 
calculated as 8*12 x 10"' 5 cm./sec*/volt/cm* with a range of from 
7*62 to 8*51 at pH 3,5* (33)* 

The component that does not migrate (see Pig* 9) is 
not present in these patterns of the protein ^fractions* 1 « This 
suggested that it is a highly soluble component not precipit¬ 
ated by changes in pH over the range studied* A study was mad© 
of the supernatant liquid remaining after protein precipitates 
had been removed at pH 3 a 7, 4*0, and 4*5* The electrophoresis 
patterns were obtained at pH 3,5, using formic acid-sodium for¬ 
mate buffer* These patterns are shown in Pig* 11* The rapid¬ 
ly migrating component is absent in these patterns, but the non¬ 
migrating component is present* 

A study was next made to see whether this component 
would migrate under varying conditions of pH, The buffer used 
was 0,1N formic acid, adjusted to different pH levels, using 
0.1N sodium hydroxide* Pig* 12, 1, shows the whole protein ex¬ 
tract at pH 3*6* Pig* 12, 2, is a pattern of the supernatant

been precipitated at pH 5.0. The pattern was obtained a t pH 

5.0. 

In all these patterns, the non-migrating component is 
present. It does not migrate over a pH interval of 1.4 units. 
This shows that this component is unaffected by pH. It is 
therefore concluded that this component is a highly soluble, 
non-protein macromolecular substance# H is possible that it 
is a polysaccharide, but no attempt has been made to identify 
it. 


Eo Preliminary Diffusion Studies on Oat Protein 


Diffusion determinations were made on whole oat extract 
obtained with 0.1N formic acid and on a protein precipitate ob¬ 
tained by dialysing the whole oat extract against formic acid- 
sodium hydroxide solution at pH 6«3 0 The whole oat extract and 
the precipitated protein, redispersed in 0.1N formic acid, were 
dialysed in formic acid-sodium formate buffer as used in the 
electrophoresis determinations. The diffusion constant was cal- 
culated. using the formula D = _41 _ given by

The results show there is a decrease in diffusion 
constant with time* ^his is probably due to mixing of the 
solutions at the time the boundary was formed* 

The whole oat protein extract in formic acid has a 
higher rate of diffusion than has the protein precipitated at 
pH 6*3* Each diffusion constant is a mean of the diffusion 
rates of all individual particles in what is obviously a 
polydisperse system (see Pigs* 13 and 14)* The lower diffu¬ 
sion constant of the precipitated protein may be due to the 
presence of heavy particles, a high degree of assymetry of the 
particles, aggregation of the particles, or a combination of 
these factors* Both protein solutions were turbid and as tur¬ 
bidity has been associated with aggregation of gluten parti¬ 
cles in sodium salicylate (35), this is probably one of the 
factors involved. The higher diffusion constant of the whole 
oat extract must be due to the presence of some lighter dif¬ 
fusing material in the extract* 

No diffusion constants were determined on the super¬ 
natant liquid from which the protein precipitate had been re¬ 
moved* The solution was not sufficiently concentrated to obtain 
accurate diffusion results* However, the particles present in 
the supernatant liquid must have a high diffusion constant, 
and therefore they probably are much smaller than the average 
particles in the precipitated protein* 







- 49 - 


The diffusion patterns of the whole extract and of the 
redispersed protein, together with the theoretical normal curves, 
are shown in Figs<, 13 and 14o Since the normal curves do not fit 
the experimental curve for either of the protein solutions, the 
diffusing particles must be polydisperse# 

These diffusion results must be regarded only as pre¬ 
liminary as many of the experimental conditions were relatively 
unsatisfactory© 


Fo Miscellaneous Experiments 


Amide Nitrogen in Oat Protein 

Amide nitrogen content of proteins is relatively simple 
to determine and, with wheat gluten, is very useful in different¬ 
iating successive fractionso The more soluble prolamine-type 
of protein is high in amide nitrogen while the less soluble, 
glutamine-type is much lower. 

The characteristics of oat protein are quite different 
. from those of wheat gluten and it was thought that the deter¬ 
mination of amide nitrogen might show some of the differences*

Amide nitrogen determinations on gluten have been made by 
many investigators* including McCalla and ^ose (36)* '^hese 
workers observed that the main gluten fractions, obtained by 
salting out the protein with saturated magnesium sulfate sol¬ 
ution, showed an increase in amide nitrogen with an increase 
in solubility of the protein* 

Larmour (27) conducted a comparative study of glu- 
telins of the cereal grains# Glutelins were prepared by ex¬ 
traction with 0#2 °/o alkali# A concise summary of his findings 
is presented, in tabular form, by Gortner (16, page 461 )© 
Larmour reports that wheat glutenin has 14 «Q% amide nitrogen 
compared to a value of lb 0 Q% given by ^lish and Sandstedt (6)* 
Avenin, the glutelin of oats, was reported to have an amide 
nitrogen content of 11#9$* 

In the present investigation aliquots of oat extract 
in 0#1N formic acid were dialysed against mixtures of formic 
acid-sodium hydroxide at various pH levels, using the same 
technique as that employed in preparing fractions for ele¬ 
ctrophoresis® The amide nitrogen was determined using a modi¬ 
fied procedure given by Plimmer and Hosedale (41)* 

The results of this experiment are given in Table 5#

From these results it is possible to conclude that 
the least soluble fraction of oat protein definitely differs 
in amide nitrogen content from the remainder of the fractions * 
According to the precipitation curve given in Fig* 5, approx¬ 
imately 50$ of the total oat protein is precipitated between 
pH 4*2 and It must be concluded that the amide nitrogen 

content of this 50$ is approximately a constant value*

Coinparing these results with those of wheat gluten 
(36) there are two main differences in amide nitrogen dist¬ 
ribution* First, the amide content is much lower for oat pro¬ 
tein, except for the first fraction recorded in Table 5; and 
second, there is no progressive change in amide content with 
progressive fractionation* These results must be considered 
as only preliminary in nature* 


2 • Wheat Gluten in Formic Acid 

» 

Gluten was formed and washed in the usual manner (14)* 
The gluten ball was tom into small pieces and dispersed in 
0.1N formic acid. The dispersion was shaken intermittently and 
the gluten was completely dispersed in about 6 hours* ^he 
dispersion was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4000 r*p*m 0 Ni¬ 
trogen was determined and the dispersion diluted to 0*7$ pro¬ 
tein* The dispersion was then dialysed for 48 hours and ele¬ 
ctrophoretic determinations were made* The patterns are 
shown in Fig # 16* 

Gluten in formic acid was positively charged and 
appears to be partially resolved into four components* There

is a considerable degree of spreading, indicating that the 
components of the dispersion are probably electrostatically 
polydisperse. A somewhat similar gluten pattern was obtained 
by ^olvin (8) when he used 0.1N acetic acid for dispersing 
gluten. 

For comparative purposes. Fig. 15 shows gluten in 0.5// 
sodium benzoate and 0.5// sodium salicylate solution. The 
patterns for these two dispersing agents are alike but are 
quite different from that obtained using formic acid. 

McCalla and Gralen (35) have observed that gluten in 
sodium se.licylate is a heterogeneous protein. In sodium ben¬ 
zoate and sodium salicylate gluten behaves as an electrostatic¬ 
ally homogeneous protein. This suggests that the original 
electrostatic properties of gluten may be masked by salicylate 
ions. Because of the similarity of these two neutral salts, 
it is assumed that sodium benzoate behaves in a manner similar 
to that of sodium salicylate. Gluten is not a homogeneous pro¬ 
tein when studied in acetic and formic acids. Consequently, 
the use of sodium salicylate and sodium benzoate for electro¬ 
phoretic study of gluten protein yields no information regard¬ 
ing the properties of the original protein. It appears that 
there is an ion-protein complex formed in these solutions and

an electrophoretic study gives a measure of the electrostatic 
properties of the complexes which are determined largely by 
the presence of large numbers of salicylate or benzoate ions* 
Egg white in sodium salicylate and Sorenson*s phos¬ 
phate buffer has been studied by Colvin (8). Essentially the 
same electrophoretic pattern was obtained using these two 
solutions* Colvin assumed that this indicated that the two 
dispersing agents behaved similarly® McCalla* states that this 
may be so for egg white but not for gluten* ^he former is in 
solution in its natural state and there may be little or no 
reaction with salicylate ions* Gluten, on the other hand, is 
dispersed only by the effect of salicylate ions, possibly 
adsorbed on, or reacted with, the protein® 

In Pigs. 6 and 7 there is a close similarity in the 
electrophoretic patterns of oat protein in sodium benzoate and 
sodium salicylate solutions® ^hese patterns differ from the 
pattern of oat protein in formic acid in that there is much less 
resolution® ^t can therefore be concluded that the dispersing 
action of sodium benzoate and sodium salicylate on oat protein 
is similar to the action of these salt3 on gluten*
