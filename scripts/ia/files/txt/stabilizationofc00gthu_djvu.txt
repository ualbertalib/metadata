SYNOPSIS: 


The electrical treatment of clay soils resul 
in the changing of some of its properties and 
yields certain constants which a given s~il mm 
may possess. 

In the investigation of the effects of elec¬ 
trical treatment on the Atterberg Limits of Steam 
boat Creek Clay, Dunvegan Clay Shale, Biological 
Building site clay and Namao Airport clay it was 
found there was no definite trend in the change 
of these properties. 

The moisture content of a given clay soil 
can be decreased by electrical means which means 
a corresponding increase in the shearing strength 
of the treated sample. 

The clay from the site of the Biological 
Building was treated by electrosmosis and the 
result was an increase in the unconfined comp¬ 
ressive strength of the clay of 30 to 40 times 
that of the untreated sample at the same moisture 


content. 





Consolidation tests on the treated samples 
revealed that the e-log.P curve for the treated 
sample was displaced with respect to the e-log,P 
curve for the untreated sample. This phenomena 
was observed in the case of treated samples of 
Biological Building Site clay and Steamboat Creek 
clay. 


The coefficient of electrical permeability 
for the samples of Steamboat Creek Clay tested 
was found to be about 5x 10"° cm / sec.volt 
which is about 1000 times greater than the 
coefficient of hydraulic permeability. The 
specific resistance was found to be about 60 ohm/cm. 

The coefficient of electrical permeability 
for Dunvegan Clay Shale was found to be 2x 10”^ 
cm 2 / sec.volt and new bedding planes were produc¬ 
ed due to such electrical treatment. 

Lignosol and Calgon solutions can be success¬ 
fully moved through soil by the means of electros- 
mosis. The coefficient of electrical permeability 
for the soils tested when lignosol and calgon

were the transported liquid was found to be app- 
roximately 3x 10 ^cm / sec. volt. When these 
treated samples were subjected to frost heave 
conditions it wasfound that the heave had been 
reduced from 11.3% for an untreated sample to about 
3.0 fo for the K treated samples. 

The results of this investigation proves con¬ 
clusively that solutions other than water can be 
moved through soils tested by means of electrosmosis. 





ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: 


This research has been extremely 
interesting to the author because electrical 
treatment of soils from an engineering point 
of view is only in its infancy even though 
the phenomena of electrosmosis was observed 
as early as about 1810. It is for opening 
this new field in Soil Mechanics to the 
author that he would like to express his 
gratitude to Dean R.M. Hardy, under whose 
direction this research was carried out. 

The author would also like to 
express his appreciation to Professor S.R. 
Sinclair for his helpful criticisms and 
suggestions.

SCOPE: 


Clay from four different areas and a prepaired 
silt soil were investigated in this research.. The 
soils investigated and the properties which may be 
affected by the electrical treatment and investigated 
are stated as follows: 

(1) Steamboat Bridge Clay: 

The desired knowledge of the effect on this 
soil resulting from electrical treatment and 
using different types of electrodes was: 

a. , the specific resistance of the natural soil. 

b. the value of the coefficient of electrical 
permeability of the soil. 

c. the change in moisture content due to such 
treatment.. 

d. the change in the Atterberg Limits due to 
the electrical treatment. 

(2) Namao Clay: 

This clay was used primarily to check the 
effect of electrical treatment on the Atterberg 
Limits and the coefficient of electrical permea¬ 
bility of the soil as found when using Steamboat 
Creek clay.

HISTORY: 

The development of the voltaic pile made available 
a source of steady direct current, which removed many 
of the restrictions imposed on research by the use of 
the isolated electric charges of the frictional mach¬ 
ines, The development of this source of direct current 

* 

led to a series of electrolysis experiments (1) and to 
the development of theories which were formulated from 
1800 to 1807.. Stimulated by these advances, Reuss (2) 
reported in 1808 a series of observations made the 
previous year,. The observations made by Reuss are 
stated in the following paragraph. 

Reuss had noted in some experiments conducted 
in his garden that the products of electrolysis in a 
voltaic pile developed equally well under certain con¬ 
ditions if the electrodes were one inch or two hundred 
paces apart. Reuss stated: "I obtained this inter¬ 
esting result, previously unknown, from experiments 
made on the shore of the Moscwa and on the ground of 
my garden. The gas was in each case given off with 
equal rapidity at the ends of small poles when they 
were one inch in a glass of water and when they were 
separated by a layer of water two hundred paces or 
by a layer of damp earth ten, twenty or more archineSo ,,

Reuss strove to explain this effect on the hyper- 
thesis that the "galvanic fluid” passing from the 
metalic poles into the interpolar liquid combined with 
one of the elements of the interpolar liquid. Upon 
combination the galvanic fluid carried this element 
along with it to the opposite pole to leave it again 
on re-entering the metal pole. In his explanation he 
suggested that, secondary to the flow of electricity, 
charged particles could exist in solution between the 
electrodes and perhaps show plainly, as Abramson (3) 
has stated: "That the galvanic fluid, while passing 
from one of the metallic poles into the interpolar 
liquid, combines with one of the elements and there 
liberated the other in the isolated state; that it 
parts from the element it has seized while traversing 
the interpolar liquid toward the opposite pole, then 
leaving the element it has conducted to enter the 
metal pole." 

To demonstrate that charged particles of matter 
could exist not only at the electrodes but also in the 
interpolar liquid, Reuss performed two experiments. 

In the one he demonstrated what is now called electro— 
smosis. In the second,.what he described was apparently 
the transport of suspended clay particles by the elec¬ 
tric field, called cataphoresis.

The apparatus used by Reuss (2) for his experi¬ 
ments (Fig. 1)was a U-tube about one-quarter of an 
inch in diameter and eight inches long having two 
platinum wires fused in at the bottom.. 



Fig.. 1 . APPARATUS USED BY REUSS TO 
DEMONSTRATE ELECTROSMOSIS. 

From H.A. Abramson. 

Powdered quartz was placed at the bottom between the 
wires, the entire U-tube then being filled with water. 
The platinum wires were then connected to a voltaic 
pile. Reuss observed that a few seconds after the 
poles were connected to the platinum wires and the 
oxygen and hydrogen gases started to be given off rap¬ 
idly, the water at the negative pole began to rise in 
the little tube which opened off that side, so that 
fifteen or twenty minutes after the action commenced 
the water had risen 9*3 inches above its original 
level. At the same time the water in the other arm

of the tube,.at the positive pole,, descended in propor¬ 
tion., When the connection was broken, ; the water immed¬ 
iately began to return to its original level, falling 
on the negative side and rising on the positive side.. 
As soon as the connection with the poles was re-estab¬ 
lished the water rose again on the negative side and 
descended on the positive side. 

This transport of water to the negative pole, aa 
demonstrated by Reuss, did not occur to any appreciable 
extent in the absence of the diaphragm of powder. The 
reason for this phenomena is explained in the "theory" 
to follow. 

In his second experiment Reuss used a block of 
moist powdered clay eleven inches long and two and one- 
half inches wide, and of the same thickness. Two glass 
tubes, about one inch diameter and three inches long, 
were spaced five and one-half inches and sunk one-half 
of an inch, into this block of moist clay. A layer of 
well washed sand was placed on the clay at the bottom 
of each tube then covered with water. Soon after the 
current was sent through the system by means of elec¬ 
trodes immersed in the glass tubes, the clay serving 
as the base of the positive cylinder began to swell 
and rise in the tube, elevated to the same extent the

sand which covered it.. There was no change in the 
level of the liquid in the cylinders themselves. 

After a half hour the clay particles were dif¬ 
fused in the positive cylinder, partly penetrating 
through the covering layer of sand and forming near 
the wall of the cylinder a small pointed elevation. 
Gradually this spread over the sand layer and extended 
about one-half inch above it. Nothing noteworthy was 
observed in the negative cylinder.. The movement of the 
clay particles was due to their transport by the elec¬ 
tric current. Reuss had demonstrated that the water in 
contact with certain surfaces was electropositive and 
that the surface itself was electronegative and con¬ 
sequently capable of being attracted by the positive 
pole. 


In 1852 Wiedemann (4) reported his findings in 
electrosmosis experiments up to that time. Wiedemann 
made use of apparatus similar to that used by Reuss 
and attempted to derive empirical laws relating the 
quantity of liquid transported to the quantity of curr¬ 
ent and to the magnitude of the electromotive force. 

Quincke ( 5 ) (1859) was the first to suggest that 
the converse of the phenomenon producing electrosmosis

would give rise to an electric current. That is,, no one 
had observed that if a liquid were forced past a surface 
or through a porous diaphragm, current would flow during 
the streaming of the liquid, a difference of potential 
existing,, a "streaming potential"„ between the two 
sides of the diaphragm. 

In 1880 Dorn (6) found that a potential difference 
also occured when particles fall through water.. 

The history of the electrokinetic phenomena may 
be summarized as follows; in 1808 Reuss (2) observed 
that water moves through the partition of wet clay 
when an electric potential is applied, and also, that 
the suspended clay particles move in the opposite dir¬ 
ection. About fifty years later Quincke (5) observed 
that an electric potential is produced when water is 
forced through a clay soil diaphragm and Dorn (6) dis¬ 
covered that a potential difference occurs when par¬ 
ticles fall through water.

THEORY: 


The Electrokinetic Phenomena : 

The electrokinetic phenomena result in the pro¬ 
duction or application of an E.M.F. The displacement 
of a liquid along a boundary surface or conversely the 
displacement of a solid surface relative to a liquid, 
is produced by an externally applied electromotive 
force;.reversing the process, an E.M.F. may be generated 
by displacement of a liquid relative to a solid surface 
or of a solid relative to a liquid.. The classification, 
of the electrokinetic phenomena are as follows: 

A*. An external E.M.F. produces motion 

(1) of the liquid against a solid surface. 

ELECTROSMOSIS 

(2) of the solid particles against a liquid. 

EXECTRhPHORESIS. 

B. An externally caused motion produces an E.M.F.

surface.. STREAMING POTENTIALS.

electrosmo_sis and Quincke 1 s (1861), investigations into 
streaming potentials by investigation on single capill¬ 
aries and compressed powders (multicapillaries )„ Helm¬ 
holtz (7),(1879) worked out the first mathematical 
theory of the phenomena for the erase of a single capill¬ 
ary o. In this analysis, the assumption was made that an. 
electric double-layer (fig. 2) exists in the capillary 
wall, one layer residing in the film that adheres to 
the capillary, and the other residing nearby in the body 
of the liquid and able to move with it..

A flow of the liquid parallel to the face of the

tial between the two ends of the tube by dragging the 
layer in the body of the liquid to one end. This move¬ 
ment may be produced due to a hydraulic head. Under

similar conditions a potential gradient parallel to the 
solid boundary tends to displace the two phases tangen- 



the column of liquid in the single 


capillary being pulled through at a uniform velocity 
by the friction between, the moving ions at the periphery 
and the true liquid., 

Nerst.(8),specifically identified the electric 
double-layer with the space charge resulting from the 
non-uniform distribution of ions at interfaces and in 
further development of the theory of the electric 
double-layer,.Lamb (9) considered slippage at the inter¬ 
face and difference in the thickness of the double¬ 
layer and of the liquid layer in which shear takes place. 

H.S. Taylor (10) stated the current views concern¬ 
ing the structure of the electric double-layer may be 
schematically illustrated in Fig. 3.

This illustration is for a surface bearing a net negative 
charge,, which is supposed to be due to either the accumul¬ 
ation of aniona from the adjacent liquid or to the dis¬ 
sociation of cations from the solid surface.. 


If the surface is a portion, of a suspended particle, 
the particle with its double-layer is electro-ehemically 
equivalent to an electrolyte, the particle and the inner 
layer behaving as a large multivalent anion and the cor¬ 
responding cations being in the outer layer.. 


The following explanation of electrosmosis is 
based on Perrin's (11).theory. Consider a capillary 
tube filled with water in which two electrodes are in¬ 
serted (Fig. 4).. If the electrodes are connected to an 
external direct current source, causing a current to 
flow in the liquid, the inside of the capillary behaves 
as if it had an electric double-layer next to the solid 
boundary.

In our theory we have considered that the layer A 
of Fig*.3 has an excess of cations and that the layer 
B of the same figure has an excess of anions. The 
layer A, which is dominant in negative charge,, is the 
zone of the liquid-solid interface and has high viscosity 
and therefore will resist movement to the anode under 
the effect of an applied E.M.F. The water in layer B, 
which is dominant in' positive charges, is not held as 
rigidly as layer A and therefore overcomes the friction 
due to the viscosity of the water at the boundary and 
moves to the cathode under the influence of an externally 
applied E.M.F. The water in the region of the center of 
the capillary has a net charge of zero and therefore is 
not attracted to either electrode but it is drawn along 
with the layer B to the cathode. The external electric 
force serves to overcome the friction and to maintain 
the constant speed with which the volume of liquid is 
moved. 

If we consider the volume of water forced through 

the capillary per unit of time we obtain:

This average velocity of flow holds in the whole interior 
of the tube because the water towards the center of the 
tube is being dragged along with the mobile layer moving

to the cathode*. Consider that the surface where the 

electric force takes effect and overcomes the friction,, 

that is the distance of the double-layer from the 

fixed side, the liquid already moves with velocity ^

The gradient of Velocity therefore lies within the

ectric constant D because he considered it to be neg¬ 
ligible but Pellat and Perrin (12) introduced it within 
the region of the double layer..

Debye and Huckel (14) obtained a similar equation in 
which the ,, 4' 1 is replaced by a shape factor that equals 
6 for the special case of a sphere.. Freundlich and 
Abramson (16) on the other hand have empirically shown 
the shape factor to be constant for a wide range of 
particle sizes and shapes,.but they have not been able 
to choose its value with certainty..

The forces which are exerted in the electrokinetic 


experiments in order to move the two sides of the double- 
layer relative to one another are claimed by Freundlich 
(16) to be by no means great enough for the liquid to be 
torn off the surface of the solid*. For this reason, it 
was assumed in the derivation of our electrosmotic equa¬ 
tions that the mobile layer of liquid towards the interior 
moves against the layer of liquid adhering to the solid 
surface and not against that surface itself. In the 
Nerst Theory (8) the double-layer is situated in the 
solid surface, and not in the liquid adhering to it, and 
therefore the two sides of this double-layer are not 
able to move relatively to one another.. We must there¬ 
fore consider the two layers of the double-layer to be 
at a distance of a few molecules from the solid surface 
into the liquid.. One part of this layer, therefore, 
lies in the liquid film adhering to the solid surface,, 
and the other part in the movable liquid. Freundlich 
(16) considers £ to be the difference of potential 
between the solid and the movable liquid, £ that be¬ 
tween the liquid adhering to the wall and the movable 
liquid.. 

From Fig.. 5 after Smoluchowski (13), who also 
reached the same view as Freundlich, the relationships 
are easily shown..

Fall of Potential at 
the Surface of a Solid 
Wall Against a Liquid. 

Curve 1 and 2 are two 
different types of curves 
depending on the concen¬ 
trations of the ions in 
the solution. 

Consider to the left of A is the solid wall, to the 
right of B the movable liquid, and between A and B the 
film of liquid adhering to the wall. The abscissa is 
the distance from a point in the solid wall, and the 
ordinates are potentials. Freundlich (16) states that 
when we measure potentials of galvanic cells we find the 
total fall of potential between the solution and the 
solid phase, say glass, £ - . In electroklnetic 

experiments, the reult depends only upon the fall of 
potential between the movable liquid and the firmly ad¬ 
hering film of liquid £ = .. It has been found 

that at high concentrations ^ becomes small or zero, 

£ does not. 

Borelius (17) explains the significance of the 
change in the zeta ( £ ) potential at high concentrations

asf follows: at high concentrations of electrolyte the 
electrokinetic phenomena will become insignificant and 
will disappear because the double-layer will no longer 
reach far enough into the liquid; at the point where 
the layer of liquid adhering to the wall passes over in¬ 
to the movable liquid, appreciable differences of pot¬ 
ential will no longer exist. Besides this influence,, 
the increase in conductivity causes a decrease in the 
electrokinetic action..

From Electricity and Magnetism by Gilbert 









In water the wall-layer for the great majority of 
solids is charged negatively with respect to the movable 
liquid, therefore water has the higher dielectric con¬ 
stant.. Water therefore moves by electrosmosis towards 
the negative pole in clays. This consideration is very 
important when considering oxides of the electrodes being 
deposited in the soil during electrosmosis and also 
experiments in electrosmosis when using other liquids 
other than water (i.e. lignosol,. water-glass, calcium 
chloride solution etc.) Perrin (11) had realized that 
the electrokinetic phenomena are particularly marked 
in liquids of high dielectric constant and therefore 
had introduced it into the Helmholtz equation as it 
was shown in the earlier theory.

SOILS USED IN ELECTRICAL STABILIZATION INVESTIGATIONS: 


Soils from five different areas were investigated: 

(1) Steamboat Creek Clay: 

This soil was obtained from the area adjacent to. 
the abutments of the bridge crossing Steamboat Creek at 
mile 340 (approx..) on the Alaska Highway.. It is an in¬ 
organic clay of high plasticity and classified as a 
CH in the Airfield Classification System., 

These samples were obtained with many others from 
the area adjacent to the abutments of a number of bridges 

an 

along the Alaska Highway. The samples were used for A in¬ 
vestigation pur pofiga . into the cause of the abutments of 
these bridges being pushed inwards and thereby causing 
serious damage to the structures. 

The desired knowledge from the electrical treatment 
of this soil was; 

a. - the specific resistance of the natural soil. 

b. the change in moisture content due to electrical 
treatment. 

c. . the change in the Atterberg Limits. 

d. the value of the coefficient of electrical perme¬ 
ability..

(2) Namao Olay: 

These soils, which were obtained from the Namao.. 
Airport, are.of two classifications. The first class¬ 
ification is a OH in the Airfield Classification and 
the other a CL,.but both soil samples are of the same 
geological origin.. This is indicated by the fact that 
when they are plotted on. a Plasticity Chart, a line 
which joins the two plotted points will be parallel to 
the A-line. Alkali salts are present in these soils to 
a varying degree,. 

This soil was used to compare the effect of elec¬ 
trical treatment on the Atterberg Limits, coefficient 
of electrical permeability and the effect of different 
metals for electrodes used to that found when Steamboat 
Creek clay was used for testing purposes. 

(3) Dunvegan Clay Shale: 

Dunvegan Clay Shale is a highly pre-compressed 
silty clay of marine origin, and classified as a CL in 
the A.C.. system.. The pre-consolidation pressure is 
6..4 tons/sq. ft., and the presence of water-beetles 
shells in the stratified shale indicates its marine 
origin.. 


This material was being used as fill material in

highway construction by the Department of Highways of 
the province of Alberta and was found to be unstable 
under certain conditions*. 

It was suggested that this clay shale may have 
similar properties to that of 3earpaw Shale*. The Bear- 
paw shale was encountered in the investigation of the 
site for the proposed South Saskatchewan Dam by P.F.R.A. 
The Atterberg Limits of this shale were found to be very 
sensitive to method of preparing the soil,, different 
operator and different machine used. With this know¬ 
ledge,, an investigation was entered into the effects of 
method of drying of the soil,, amount of mixing, water 
used, time of soaking of the prepared sample and the 
effect of electrical treatment on the Atterberg Limits 
of the clay shale*. 

(4) Biological Building Clay: 

This clay was obtained from the site of the pro¬ 
posed Biological Building on the University of Alberta 
campus. It is a light brown, silty clay of medium 
plasticity* 

The clay was treated by electrosmosis and then the 
unconfined compressive strength of the soil in the region 
of the anode and cathode, after having used different

metal electrodes, was investigated*. These values were 
compared with the position of the straight line relation¬ 
ship of moisture content vs., log. unconfined compressive 
strength of the natural soil in order to determine the 
stabilization properties resulting from such electrical 
treatment. 

(5) Silt:. 

A prepared sample of sand-silt was used in the 
investigation of the possibility of moving liquids other 
than water through soils by means of electrosmosis. 

The samples treated in this matter were then sub¬ 
jected to frost heave conditions in order to observe 
the stabilization effect of this electro-chemical 


treatment. 





SPECIAL TESTING- AND SAMPLING- EQUIPMENT: 


Eleotrosmosis Equipment : 

The eleotrosmotic cell used in the research was 
designed by E.L. Fowler (19) and all parts to be in con¬ 
tact with the fluid and the soil, but to be a non-cron- 
ductor of elecrtriclty, were made of lucite. This fac¬ 
ilitated observing phenomena occurring during the test¬ 
ing which would not have been possible if the apparatus 
had been constructed of opaque materials. It was also 
possible, due to the construction of the apparatus, to 
use detachable electrodes of different metals. The two 
metals used for electrodes in this investigation were 
iron and aluminum. A picture of the electrosmotic cell, 
power pack, voltmeter, ammeter, graduate for collecting 
the fluid and wire leads is shown in Photo 1.

The ammeter was graduated from zero to one hundred 
mill! amps, and the voltmeter had three scales; zero 
to three volts, zero to thirty volts and zero to one 
hundred and fifty volts. 

The Dunvegan Clay Shale as stated under ’Soils 
used in: Electrical Stabilization Investigations* is a 
highly pre-compressed silty clay and therefore it was 
not possible to cut such samples as those required for 
the consolidation and electrosmosis tests with ease. 
The method used to obtain such samples is illustrated 
in Photo 2.

Samples from Dun- 
vegan Clay Shale

The sample of Dunvegan Clay Shale was placed under 
the loading yoke of the ’scale loading device*. It 
was found necessary to use a mold of some kind to act. 
as a guide on the size of the sample cut and to give 
stability.

In the picture shovm (see photo 2) a 1,4 inch dia¬ 
meter tube was used, The sample was trimmed to a slightly 
larger diameter below the cutting edge of the tube so 
that the tube could be forced down over the section 
trimmed and retain that portion of the sample, A very 
slight shock to the system,, however, resulted in failure 
of the whole sample and therefore the tedious task was 
started anew,. The average time to obtain one sample was 
seventy minutes, Shis method of sampling made it poss¬ 
ible to obtain a straight sample of uniform diameter,. 

Another electrosmotic cell used by the author is 
shown in Photo 3. It is a lucite tube fitted with 
stops to hold the electrodes against the contained 

It became necessary 
to use this device when 
the samples obtained 
were too short to be 
placed in the electro¬ 
smotic cell designed by 
Fowler (19) and still be 
in contact with the 
electrodes.

The Biological Building clay was used to deter 
mine the possibility of increasing the stability 
of this clay by electrical means. It was believed 
that the soil near one sign of electrode ( / or -) 
would yield a greater degree of stabilization than 
the other. To investigate this possibility it was 
found necessary to use the Fisher Balance strength 
test equipment for determining the unconfined compr 
essive strength of the soil. The Reason for this i 
that it would not have been possible to obtain a 
standard one inch diameter sample from each end of 
the treated soil due to its siort length. T e 
Fisher Balance equipment only requires a one cm. 
diameter sample and a length of about two and a 
half times its diameter, and t lerefore one could 
obtain approximately ten sam les from tne anode and 
cathode ends of the treated clay.

PRQC3DUR2: 


Steamboat Greek Clay : 

The first clay investigated in this research was 
from Steamboat Creek Bridge on the Alaska Highway. 

In electrosmosis tests performed on. this soil, 
measurements of voltage, current, water collected and 
time were recorded as the test progressed. In the first 
electrosmosis test a sample of Steamboat Creek clay H-2, 
D-5 was used and the potential applied, to the sample 
through an aluminum electrode.. For the first ten min¬ 
utes the water was discharged at a constant rate but 
thereafter the rate of discharge kept decreasing. 

Graph D of plate 7 representing Water Collected vs. 

Time illustrates this point. This was an unexpected 
phenomena. In order to investigate the cause of what 
had occured,. the electrosmosis cell was dismantled. It 
was observed that the electrodes were slightly corroded 
and also the anode had been attacked to a greater de¬ 
gree than the cathode but the pores in the electrode 
plates were still open.. 

The same sample was left in the electrosmotic cell 
but the iron electrodes were used this time. The rate

of discharge as shown on Fig. E plate 7 remained at a 
constant rate throughout the test. As the test pro¬ 
gressed the water on the cathode side of the sample 
gradually took on a rusty appearance which became more 
noticeable as the time of testing continued, whereas 
the water on the anode side of the sample retained its 
clear appearance. This was due to the iron in solution 
being attracted to the cathode. Due to the straight 
line relationship of water collected vs. time during the 
test it was possible to determine the coefficient of 
electrical permeability {Az e ) of the sample. 

Another sample of the same clay was inserted into 
the electrosmotic apparatus and iron electrodes were 
used. With an applied potential across the sample a 
constant rate of discharge of the water occurred and 
continued throughout the test as indicated by Fig F 
plate 8. When the iron electrodes were removed they 
had a rusty appearance and the pores in the electrodes 
were still open.. 

Aluminum electrodes were placed in contact with 
the soil sample-and once again a potential difference 
applied across the clay. Once again the rate of dis¬ 
charge decreased with time as it had before with 
sample D plate 7 when aluminum electrodes were used.

When the aluminum electrodes were removed it was 
observed that the anode had been attacked to a greater 
degree than the cathode but the pores in both the anode 
and cathode were still open. 

The next sample of Steamboat Creek Clay tested was 
sample H-l D-5. Iron electrodes were used and once 
again a constant rate of discharge of water from the 
cathode took place, under an applied potential differ¬ 
ence between the anode and cathode. 

This same phenomena occurred in two other experi¬ 
ments on samples H-l D-5 when iron electrodes were used 
even though the test was continued for more than eight 
hours. The graphs of electrosmosis of water vs. time 
for these tests are shown in Figs. H, I, and J on 
plate 9.. 

Once again a sample from tube H-l D-5 was inserted 
into the electrosmotic cell but aluminum electrodes 
were used. It was observed that the rate of discharge 
decreased, as shown in K, plate 10, until after only 
two hours there was no further discharge of water even 
though the same potential was measured by the voltmeter. 


The apparatus was dismantled, the aluminum elec-

tro&es removed.. The anode was “badly corroded with a 
deposit of aluminum oxides on its surface. The cor¬ 
rosion appeared porous however, and the openings in 
the electrodes were still open to a sufficient degree 
to allow water to pass through them and not he a con¬ 
trolling factor on the electrosmotic permeability. 

The cathode was also corroded but to a lesser degree.. 
Both electrodes were scraped and polished before they 
were replaced in the electrosmotic cell. 

Once again a potential was applied across the 
apparatus and measurements of water collected, time, 
voltmeter reading and ammeter reading were recorded. 

The rate of discharge of water from the cathode con¬ 
tinued at a constant rate and then decreased to almost 
zero after only eighty minutes. 

The same procedure of removing the aluminum elec¬ 
trodes, polishing them and replacing them was followed 
for samples M, N, and 0.. The graphs of water collected 
vs. time for these samples are shown on plates 10 and 
11. It should be noted that the same general shape of 
curve of water collected vs. time is obtained each time. 

Consolidation tests were run to determine the 
Darcy coefficient of hydraulic permeability for each

soil tested in the electrosmotic cell. This made it 
possible to make a comparison between the coefficient 
of electrical permeability and the coefficient of hy¬ 
draulic permeability.. 

Dunve^an Glay Shale : 

Electrosmosis tests were performed on Dunvegan 
Clay Shale with aluminum and iron electrodes. The 
swne procedure was used as that used for the other 
clays tested above and the same pattern of results 
were obtained depending on the electrode used. See 
tests A,. B, and C on plates 6 and 7. 

Unconfined Compressive Strength Tests : 

Unconfined compressive strength tests were per¬ 
formed on Biological Building clay before it had been 
treated electrically and after. Both aluminum and 
iron electrodes were used. This was another method 
used in determining the stabilization effect of elec¬ 
trical treatment on certain types of clay shales. It 
was necessary to use the Fisher Balance equipment (one 
cm., diameter samples) and the standard University of 
Alberta method for this apparatus in order to obtain 
samples from both the anode and cathode ends of the 
soil samples. This made it possible to determine the

difference in stabilizing effect at the anode and 
cathode when using aluminum or iron electrodes and 
number of days treated. In all cases seventy milli 
amps, and the same length of sample were used in 
order to eliminate as many variables as possible. 

Consolidation and Atterberg Liquid Limit tests 
were performed on the Biological clay in order to ass¬ 
ist in obtaining the correct slope of the moisture con¬ 
tent vs. log., unconfined compressive strength curves 
plotted for the soil. 

A consolidation test was run on the same soil 
after it had been treated by electrosmosis so that the 
change ih the e -log. P curves could be determined 
and be compared with the consolidation curve of the 
soil before having been treated.. 

Atterbers; Limit Investigation of Dunve.^an Clay Shale 

It was stated earlier that it was believed Dun- 
vegan Clay Shale was similar to Bearpaw shale in that; 
it was sensitive to various procedures used in prepar¬ 
ing the soil before running the Atterberg Limit tests.. 
To investigate this, the number of variables which 
affect the Atterberg Limit tests were reduced by the

author performing the tests (therefore one operator) 
and using one liquid limit machine for all tests per¬ 
formed*. 

Two samples of Dunvegan Clay Shale were obtained; 
one sample was oven dried and the other air dried. 

After the samples had dried, each was ground separately 
and passed through a #40 sieve (U.S. Standard)*. If we 
select the air dried material for discussion purposes, 
the following procedure was followed: 

1. the same amount of sieved soil for performing the 
tests was placed in each of six bowls. 

2* the same amount of distilled water per bowl was 

added to three of the samples so that the paste of 
soil would have a moisture content below the liquid 
limit after it had been thoroughly mixed, 

3. the same amount of distilled water was added to 

the other three bowls so that the resulting paste 
would have a moisture content above the liquid 
limit when thoroughly mixed* 

4*. the six bowls were placed in the moist room and 
covered with a damp paper towel to help prevent 
any loss of moisture from the prepared soils*. 

5.. after the samples had soaked for one day, the 
Atterberg Limits were determined on one sample 
which had been mixed on the wet side of the liquid

limit, and one which had been mixed on the dry side 
of the liquid limit.. 

The same procedure was followed for the other 
samples after they had soaked for two and then three 
days. 

The same procedure as stated for the air dry 
soil was used for the oven dry soil. 

The method used for the Atterberg Limits in all 
other tests and the basis used for comparison is the 
University of Alberta method. It is similar to the 
A.S.T.M. Designations D 423-39, D 424-39, and D 427-39 
for Soils Testing except that the soil is prepared 
and soaked for one day before testing.

Electrical Drying of Clays : 


Samples of Namao Airport Clay and Steamboat Creek 
Clay were dried by electrical means and the moisture 
content at intervals from the cathode determined. The 
decrease in moisture content of these soils is very 
important from the strength point of view. G-raphs of 
moisture content vs. distance from cathode in inches 
were plotted and may be seen on plates 4 and 5.

The large drop in the liquid limit as a result of

colloids which are inversibly affected by oven drying. 
The geological evidence verifies the fact that the

surprising fact is, that such a material is located on 
the Plasticity Chart well above the A-Line. Soils loc¬

groups) are found below.it. Also located below the 
A-Line are typical inorganic silts and silty clays 
( ML-MH groups) except for liquid limits less than 30, 
for which values for inorganic silts may range slightly 
above the A-Line. The reason for the location of this 
clay shale above the A-Line on the Plasticity Chart is 
that the large content of montmorillonite has a greater 
influence on the results than has the organic colloids. 

The Plasticity Chart for Dunvegan Clay Shale is 
shown on Plate 2 and the tabulation of Atterberg Limit 
results for all methods of treatment and preparation 
are shown in Table 3. 

SOIL AIR DRIED - MIXED TO THE DRY SIDE OF THE LIQUID 
LIMIT: By examining the Plasticity Chart and Table 

3 it can be seen that the Plasticity Index decreases 
with increasing number of days of soaking. The maximum 
decrease was from 23.1$ to 20.2$. The liquid limit de¬ 
creased from 45*.4$ to 41.0$. 

SOIL AIR DRIED - MIXED TO THE WET SIDE OF THE LIQUID 
LIMIT: The Plasticity Index increased with increasing

number of days of soaking. The maximum change was an 
increase of 3.4$ (20.9$ to 24.3$). There was no defin¬ 
ite trend in the liquid limits., 

SOIL OVEN DRIED - SOIL MIXED TO THE DRY SIDE OF THE 
LIQUID LIMIT: There was no definite change in the 

plasticity index but the liquid limit decreased with 
increasing number of days of soaking. However the de¬ 
crease was only 1.2$ which is within the limit of 
experimental error. 

SOIL OVEN DRIED - MIXED TO THE WET SIDE OF THE LIQUID 
LIMIT: There is no definite change in the Atterberg 

Limits. 

It should be noted that in all these cases the 
maximum change in the plasticity index is from 27.4$ 
to 19.3$ which is only 8.3$ and in most cases is very 
much less, and the maximum change in the liquid limit 
is only 6$.. The change in the Atterberg Limits of 
Bearpaw Shale, as seen from table 2,. are in the order 
of 30$ On the basis of this evidence it can be stated 
that the Dunvegan Clay shale is not of the sensitive 
type as is the Bearpaw Clay Shale. 

For further investigations into the changes of 
Atterberg Limits due to electrical treatment, the Univ¬ 
ersity of Alberta standard method will be used. (See

the Procedure).. Therefore the standard results for 
Dunvegan Clay Shale are for the soil Air Dried, soaked 
one day and mixed to the dry side of the liquid limit. 

It can he seen by examining Plate 2 that after the 
soil had been treated in the electrosmotic cell with 
iron electrodes installed, and the Atterberg Limits 
had been performed on the prepared soil that the liquid 
limit had decreased by 4.6$ to 40.8$ and the plasticity 
index dropped from 23.1$ to 13.9$. The position of 
these points when plotted on the Plasticity Chart is 
below the A-Line, which is the position for an organic 
soil. This, however, does not mean that the soil now 
is organic in nature. It must also be noted that there 
are only two results out of many. 

In the case when the soil was oven dried after it 
had been treated when using iron electrodes, the liquid 
limit decreased 9.9$ and the plasticity index decreased 
16$.. This was possibly due to cementation of the clay 
particles during oven drying and therefore the clay 
shale acquired characteristics of a coarser-grained 
material. 

The sample of Dunvegan Clay Shale tested in the 
electrosmotic cell was cut such that the bed of

stratification' was parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the cell. During the test it was observed that fine 
transverse cracks were developing in the sample. That 
is, the new cracks were formed in planes at right angle 
to the natural stratification.. At the completion of 
the test the sample was removed and a length of it air 
dried. At the completion of drying a section of the 
sample was removed which exposed one of the new beds 
of stratification. The picture is shown below. The 
lower portion of the sample which is light in color is 
the existing surface and the other portion of the sur¬ 
face has been removed in the top section, thereby 
leaving a dark surface exposed. This dark surface is 
a bright rust color or in other words is one of the 
surfaces upon which the concentration of iron oxide is 
the greatest. It should be noted that this surface did 
not exist before the sample had been treated by electro 
smosis.

The effect of using aluminum electrodes in elec¬ 
tro smo sis tests on Dunvegan Clay Shale can he seen by 
examining the Plasticity Chart on Plate 2. In both 
cases of the anode and cathode soil examined, it c^n 
be seen that the liquid limit and the plasticity index 
are both lowered, The soil in the region of the anode 
was affected to a greater extent than the soil at the 
cathode. The aluminum electrodes decreased the liquid 
limits to a greater extent than iron electrodes. The 
deposit of coarse grained oxides of aluminum in the soil 
and on the surface of the soil next to the anode is a 
possible explanation of the liquid limit of the anode 
being lower than that at the cathode. 

A Plasticity Chart for Steamboat Creek Clay is 
shown on plate 2 and tabulation of all Atterberg Limit 
results are in Table 4. 

When the electrosmotic cell had iron electrodes 
and an electrosmosis test was performed on sample 
H-l D-5„ the liquid limit was lowered from 65 * 0 % to 
63*2$., The liquid limit of an untreated sarrfple pre¬ 
pared by the standard University of Alberta method was 
63The plasticity index was lowered 3.3$ from the 
original 40 . 6 %. When aluminum electrodes were used on 
a sample from the same Shelby tube, it was found that

the liquid limit decreased by 3 . 1 % to 61.3$ and the 
plasticity index decreased by the same amount. 

When electrosmosis tests were performed on sample 
H-2 D-5 when only aluminum electrodes were used the 
liquid limit was lowered from 66.4$ to 63.4$ and the 
plasticity index lowered 3*0$ also. 

For the sample H-3 D-5 of Steamboat Creek Clay the 
reverse seems to be true. The electrosmosis test was 
performed with aluminum electrodes against the soil 
sample. The Atterberg Limit tests on this treated soil 
revealed that the liquid limit was raised from 57-8$ 
to 68.8$ and the plasticity index was also raised but 
by 9*0$ from the original value of 34.2$ in this case. 

In the case of the three samples of Steamboat Creek 
Clay tested there did not seem to be any definite trend 
in the change in the plastic limit of the soils. 

In the beginning, all the samples tested were homo¬ 
geneous but at the end of testing the soil in the region 
of the cathode was very hard and when it was broken 
with the fingers it yielded lumps of soil. These lumps 

of soil had a characteristic nugget structure. The soil 

\ 

in the region of the anode was relatively soft and

observed to be stained with the oxides of the electrode 
used in the test. 

When the aluminum electrodes had been used in the 
test, the penetration of white particles of aluminum 
oxide could be found for some distance into the sample 
from the anode. The greater concentration was observed 
to be in the near vicinity of the anode. This deposit 
of aluminum oxides in the soil may be one possible 
reason for the lowering of the liquid limit, especially 
in the region of the anode. The nugget structure was 
in effect broken down in the process of preparing the 
soil for an Atterberg Limit test and therefore the 
effect was not as great as that caused by the aluminum 
salts in the region of the anode. 

The plot of the results obtained are shown on 
the Plasticity Chart on Plate 2 and it can be seen 
that the soils remain in the same geological origin 
band even though the Atterberg Limits have changed. 

The Plasticity Chart for the Namao soils tested 
may be seen in Plate 3 and the tabulation of the 
Atterberg Limits are in Table 4. 

When Namao Clay S-l was used in the electrosmosis 
test, iron electrodes were against the soil sample.

It was? observed that only slight changes in the liquid 
limit and the plasticity index resulted, hut the plastic 
limit decreased slightly. (See table 4..) 

Namao sample U-4 D-l was placed in the electro- 
smosis cell and aluminum electrodes were used. The 
liquid limit was raised only from 36 .4% to 38.0% and 
the plastic limit and plasticity index did not change 
appreciably. 

The last sample of Namao clay tested had suffic¬ 
ient length to yield to two electrosmosis samples.. 

The first test was performed with aluminum electrodes 
in place. The liquid limit performed on the soil 
from the anode and was decreased from 103.0% by 14% 
and the plasticity index of the same soil decreased 
10..2% to a value of 56.7%.. The results of the plastic- 
limits was the soil in the region of the anode dropped 
from 36.1% to 32 . 3 %,- but was decreased by 5.5% in the 
region of the cathode. The liquid limit in the anode 
end decreased by 13*5% to a value of 89.5% and the 
plasticity index was lowered from 66.9% to 58*9% which 
is a drop of 8.0%. 

In all cases investigated, the soil near the 
anode is affected to a greater degree than the soil in 
the region of the cathode.

The second sample of this Namao; clay was inserted 
into the electrosmosis apparatus and iron: electrodes 
were used.. It was discovered that iron had the greater 
effect in lowering the liquid limit and the plasticity 
index.. The liquid limit decreased 23.5$ below that 
obtained by the Standard University of Alberta method 
on the untreated soil,, and the plasticity index de¬ 
creased 14.2$.. This agrees with the trend for the 
limits when Dunvegan Clay Shale was used as the sample 
and iron used for electrodes. 

It can be seen from the Plasticity Chart of Namao 
Airport Clays on Plate 3 that the soils of higher 
plasticity are affected to a greater degree by electro- 
smosis than those of the CL group. 

In all cases when Namao Airport Clays were treated 
electrically and the Atterberg Limit tests performed,, 
it can be seen from table 4 that the plastic limit is 
lowered. The largest drop is for Namao soil treated 
when iron electrodes were used.. This decrease in the 
plastic limit was 9.3$. 

On plates A,. B, C, the liquid limit, plastic 
limit and plasticity index are plotted against coul¬ 
ombs^ No relationship is apparent from these plots.

Inorease of Strength Due to Decrease of 

Moisture Content by Electrical Means :. 

A /' 

It was stated in the procedure that if a clay's 
moisture content could be decreased its strength would 
be increased. In order to investigate the possibility 
of decreasing the moisture content ol* a clay sample, 
Namao Airport Clay and Steamboat Creek Clay were used.. 

The results of electrioal drying of Namao Clay is 
shown on plate 4.. The first sample tested was U-4 D-2,. 
and iron electrodes were used.. It can be seen that at 
the end of the test the moisture content at the cathode 
was considerably higher than that at the anode. The 
initial moisture content was 42.7$ and the average 
final moisture content about 35;** This decrease in 
moisture content would result in an increase in the un¬ 
confined compressive strength of the soil,, the amount 
of which would depend on the slope of the moisture con¬ 
tent vs,, log. unconfined compressive strength of the 
soil. 

In the case of Namao clay U-4 D-l, the moisture 
content was not decreased as much as the previous soil 
tested but the average decrease was about 


Four samples of Steamboat Creek Clay were used

in this investigation.. The results of electrical dry¬ 
ing are shown on Plate 5.. One sample was in the electro- 
smosis apparatus for 30 minutes, the next for 60 minutes, 
the third for 90 minutes and the last of the four was 
dried for 120 minutes. By observing the plots as 
shown on plate 5 it can be seen that initially the 
moisture content drops at the anode and rises at the 
cathode. Later the moisture content is lowered even 
more at the anode and the moisture content at the 
cathode is lowered also but not to the same degree as 
the anode soil. It seems more likely that the moisture 
content at the cathode should remain the highest of any 
other portion of the sample since the water is moving 
to the cathode. The fact that the moisture moves to 
the cathode was verified by droplets of water dripping 
from the cathode during the test. A great deal of this 
expelled moisture was also lost by evaporation and 
hydrolized therefore it was not deemed practical to 
measure this small quantity of water at the cathode. 

The reason for the low moisture content at the cathode,, 
especially after 120 minutes of testing, is due to loss 
by evaporation when there is no further moisture being 
pulled through the sample by electrosraosis. The mois¬ 
ture contents at the anode should be higher than that 
found due to the same reason. The decrease in moisture 
content after 120 minutes was about 3%.

In the case of the Namao clay dried by electrical 
means,.the transport of water through the sample was 
also verified by the fact that alkali salts appeared 
at the cathode. The clay in the Namao Airport area 
are known to have a relatively high alkali content..

Effect of Type of Electrode, on the Coefficient 


of Electrical Permeability : 

In the procedure it was discussed how the type of 
electrode affects the plot of water collected vs. time,, 
in electrosmosis test. It was observed that when iron 
electrodes were used a constant discharge of water 
occurred at the cathode whereas the rate of discharge 
of water decreased to almost zero when aluminum electrodes 
were used. Plots of water collected vs. time for Dun- 
vegan Clay Shale, Steamboat Creek Clay and Namao Airport 
Clay are shown on plates 7 to 11 inclusive.. By examin¬ 
ing plots of water collected vs., quantity of electricity,, 
as shown on plates 12 to 17,, it can be seen that the re¬ 
sulting curves are very similar to those of water col¬ 
lected vs., time. 

When iron electrodes are used in electrosmosis 
tests iron oxide is in solution and travels to different 
points within the soil sample. This phenomenon has 
been verified by examining the sample after having been 
dried. For example see sample A in Photo 4.. The pres¬ 
ence of the iron oxide does not affect the porosity of 
the sample in the electrosmotic cell because it remains 
in solution. For this reason it is thought reasonable 
that the coefficient of electrical permeability should

be a constant for any given soil sample* This conform¬ 
ation of this theory is substantiated by all the plots 
of electrosmosis of water vs*, time when iron electrodes 
were used. These graphs may be seen on Plates 6 to 11 
inclusive. Due to these straight line plots it was 
possible to compute the coefficient of electrical permea¬ 
bility (Je e ) for each sample tested when this type of 
electrode was used. 

As it was stated before,, the rate of discharge of 
water from the cathode decreased with time from the 
beginning of the test when aluminum electrodes were 
used. It was also stated that the anode was attacked 
to a greater degree than the cathode but that the pores 
in the plates were still open to allow water to pass 
through them and not be a controlling factor in the 
coefficient of electrical permeability.. It was also 
observed that a considerable amount of aluminum salts 
were present on the surface of the clay sample which 
had been in contact with the anode. It has been re¬ 
ported that this oxide (21) has been found to be baux¬ 
ite when investigated by the X-ray method. It was 
stated before that the aluminum salts were found to 
have penetrated to some extent into the soil sample. 


The following discussion deals with a sample of

clay iri the eleciirosmosis test apparatus with aluminum 
electrodes irr place.. 


At the instant the direct current is allowed to 
pass through the clay sample, the aluminum electrodes 
have not started to corrode, aluminum salts have not 
been deposited in the clay soil and therefore the por¬ 
osity and the effective resistance of the system has 
not changed. As the test progresses oxygen is given off 
at the anode and the aluminum electrodes begin to cor¬ 
rode.. Particles of aluminum salts are deposited on 
the surface of the soil in contact with the anode and 
some find their way into the pores of the sample. This 
oxide increases the resistance of the system and the 
porosity of the clay is decreased, therefore the co¬ 
efficient of electrical permeability is decreased. 

This can be seen to be true when the relationship is 
examined.

As the test continues the phenomena as stated 
continues until the combination of the effects de¬ 
creased the discharge of water from the cathode to 
almost zero.. Graphs illustrating this phenomena may 
be seen on Plates 6 to 11. Another possible

explanation to the decrease of water flow is that it 
may he caused in part hy the consolidation of harden¬ 
ing effect at the cathode.. 


Due to the curved shape of the plot of water 
collected vs. time, it was not possible to compute the 
coefficient of electrical permeability as in the case 
when iron electrodes were used,, therefore and initial 
value was computed. This initial coefficient of elec¬ 


trical permeability is designated 



If plots K, L, M, N, and 0 on plates 10 and 11 
are examined it will be seen that this initial coeffic¬ 
ient of electrical permeability decreases each time a 
new electrosmosis test is performed on the same sample 
even though the electrodes have been removed and 
cleaned between tests. This decrease is attributed to 
the decrease in porosity of the sample. The further 
decrease in the rate of discharge of water from the 
cathode is caused by the increase of the resistance of 
the electrodes and the soil near the anode, thereby a 
greater drop of potential in this region than what 
existed before. The change in resistance of the system 
during the test may be seen on plates 18 and 19 where 
plots of Specific resistance vs., time are shown. In the

Table 5.. Values of Coefficient of Slectrical 
Permeability 

This table reveals that for all practical purposes, 
the coefficient of electrical permeability is about 
5 x 10~6 cm 2 /sec., volt for all soils tested. The 
values of the coefficient of electrical permeability 
obtained initially are not tabulated due to their 
erratic and misleading nature. 


























. 








The coefficient of hydraulic permeability for 
these soils may be seen tabulated in the results of 
Eleclrosmosis Tests in the appendix, and it will be 
observed that these values are of the order 
1 x 1CT 9 cm/sec*. Therefore if one assumes that a 
potential of one volt per cm. exists across a soil 
sample and then comparing the coefficient of electrical 
permeability to the coefficient of hydraulic permea¬ 
bility it will be seen that the coefficient of elec¬ 
trical permeability is one thousand times greater 
than the Darcy coefficient of permeability.. 

The specific resistance of the samples of H-l D-5 
and H-2 D -5 of Steamboat Greek Clay are 30 ohm/cmand 
65 ohm/cm., respectively..

Increase in unconfined Compression Strength due to 


E lectrical Stabilization : 

A sample of Biological Building site clay was sel¬ 
ected and a series of unconfined compression tests run 
on the soil at its natural moisture content and another 
set at a higher moisture content. 

A length of the same sample was placed in the 
elect-rosmosis apparatus, (iron electrodes used) and 
treated for four days with a steady direct current of 
70 milli.amps. At the completion of the test uncon¬ 
fined compression tests were run on the soil from the 
anode and the cathode. The sample seemed to be plastic 
but firm in the region of the anode but the soil at 
the cathode was exceedingly hard. It took a person*s 
full thrust in order to force the one cm. diameter 
sampling tube into the cathode soil, and even though 
this was done only a poor sample could be obtained. 

The plot of moisture content vs. log unconfined 
compression, strength for the Biological Building site 
Clay, treated and untreated are shown on plate 20.. It 
has been established that all plastics soils have the 
same shearing strength at the liquid limit and this

has been stated as 27 grams/cm^ or an unconfined com- 
pression strength of 54 grams/cm (22)*. This inform¬ 
ation plus the liquid limit of this soil was used to 
aid in establishing the straight line plot of moisture 
content vs*, log* unconfined compression strength for 
the soil. A consolidation test was also performed and 
the slope of the virgin compression branch is known to 
be about parallel to the moisture content vs. log. un¬ 
confined compression strength, so it was also used to 
assist in obtaining the proper slope of the desired 
line. 


It may be seen by examining plate 20 that the 
moisture content of the samples obtained from the 
electrosmosis sample had a moisture content of approx¬ 
imately 26% at the anode and 2y% at the cathode*. The 
unconfined compression strength of the untreated soil 
at these moisture contents should be of the order of 
0.07 Kgas./cm 2 ..to 0.1 Kg»*/cm 2 .. However the uncon¬ 
fined compression strengths are of the order of 
3 Kgws/cm^ which means that the strength of the clay 
has to be increased from thirty to fourty times by 
electrical treatment. Due to the experience en¬ 
countered in sampling the soil from the cathode it is 
logical that the unconfined compression strength in 
that portion of the sample is much higher than that

soil from the anode. The low results are possibly due 
to the disturbance in sampling., Slectrosmosis seems to 
have a stabilizing effect which is distinct from the 
increase in consolidation alone in the case of the anode 
clay., It should also be noted that the consolidation 
curve for the treated sample of clay has moved to the 
right and therefore its position is still in the A relative 
position, with regard to the unconfined compressive 
strengths for the treated samples as it was for the un¬ 
treated samples, when computed by the standard method.

Change in the Void Ratio Lop;,. Pressure Curves 

Due to Electrical Treatment : 

Sample of H-l D-5 of Steamboat Greek Clay was used 
in this investigation.. A sample of the natural soil 
was placed in the consolidation apparatus and the con¬ 
solidation test performed. The results of this test are 
shown in the Void Ratio vs. Log. Pressure Curves on 
plate 21. 

Another portion of sample H-l D-5 was put in the 
electrosmosis apparatus and the direct current applied 
to the soil sample through aluminum electrodes* After 
the completion of the test, a consolidation sample was 
taken from the center portion of the sample, therefore 
the consolidation results would be an indication of 
the average conditions and not influenced to a greater 
degree by the anode or cathode. The results of the 
consolidation test are shown on plate 21 also. It can 
be seen that the consolidation curve is moved in the 
direction of the arrow from the original curve on the 
untreated soil computed on the basis of saturation 
void ratt© at end of test. 


Another portion of sample H-l D-5 was put into

the electrosmosis apparatus and iron used as electrodes. 
At the completion of the electrosmosis test, a sample 
was once again taken from the center portion of the 
clay and a consolidation test performed on it. The resul 
of this consolidation test are also shown on plate 21. 
Once again the consolidation curve was moved in the 
direction of the arrow on the original consolidation 
curve, using the same method of computation as before. 

The compressive index remained the same for all 
practical purposes as can be seen from the slope of the 
virgin compression branch of the samples tested. When 
the samples were ootained for the consolidation test 
from the treated soil it was observed that the clay was 
still plastic in that region and that tnere was no 
apparent signs of excessive or even any consolidation 
having taken place. Examination of the time curves 
for the untreated clay and treated clay samples (see 
plates 22, 23 , and 24) reveals that the slope of the 
secondary compression curve is essentially the same. 
However, the time for 100 % consolidation under different 
loads is very near a constant value for the soil which 
had been subjected to electrosmosis. The time for 
100$ consolidation for the untreated sample decreased 
with increasing load.

of compression under a given load for a sample treated 
and untreated is almost the same but the resulting void 
ratio in the case of the treated clay is much higher 

In order to investigate this phenomena further, 
the e --lojp. P curve was computed such that the void 
ratio e was computed on the basis of soil solids in¬ 
stead of the final moisture content (see plate 25 ). 

It will be noticed that under this method of computation 
the e - log P curves for the treated samples are on 
each side of the curve for the untreated sample, the 
curve for the soil treated when using aluminum elec¬ 
trodes is shifted to the right.. 

Table 6 gives information as to the degree of 
saturation at the end of test computed on the basis of 
soil solids which would be required and also the spec¬ 
ific gravity of the treated soil which is required for 
a final void ratio on the basis of soil solids and the 
recorded moisture content. 

The moisture content that should exist at the end 
of test according to the void ratio computed on the 
basis of the soil solids is 20.1% and 18.3% for the 
clay treated when using aluminum and iron electrodes

have to exist under these conditions would be 109.5$ 
and 124.0$ for aluminum and iron electrode treated 
samples respectively. It is impossible to have a de¬ 
gree of saturation greater than 100$. The specific

equal the end void ratio computed on the basis of end

against the soil respectively.. These values of specific 
gravity for clays are far from the common, range of 2.70 
to 2,85.. 


The clay used in the investigation of increasing 
the unconfined compressive strength by use of electric 
means (Biological Building site) should show some char¬ 
acteristic change in the e --log P curve as did Steam¬ 
boat Creek clay. The plot of the e - log P curves for 
the soil treated and untreated (where e is computed on 
the basis of end moisture content) are shown on Plate 
26. The resulting curve for the soil treated when iron 
electrodes were used raised above the curve for the 
untreated soil. The curves had shifted to such a 
degree that the author found it advisable to check the 
weights and computations. No error could be found. 
Therefore the curves have been displaced relative to 
the other. 

Computations of the e - log P curve (Plate 27) 
were based on the volume of soil solids in order to 
investigate this phenomena further. The two curves 
are still displaced relative to the other, with the 
treated sample curve still displaced above the un¬ 
treated sample curve.

Table 7 gives information of the values of degree 
of saturation and specific gravity of the clay soil 

which would have to exist, computed on the basis of 

the void ratio with regards to soil solids. Once 

again the degree of saturation (S jo) is greater than 

100$ which is impossible. The specific gravity for 

the untreated soil is 2.51 and 2.29 for the treated 

aample. These values are too low for the clay of the 

Edmonton area.

and untreated Biological Building site clay (Plates

difference in^ time for 100^ consolidation under a given 
load for the samples is evident and the curves have the 
same general shape. In examining these consolidation 
curves it appears to he indicated that the soil is cap¬ 
able of retaining a greater amount of moisture under a - 
given load after the soil has been treated by electro- 
smosis, than it can in its natural state. The amount 
of compression for a sample treated and untreated is 
essentially the same but the resulting void ratio in 
the case of the treated clay is much higher. This 
phenomena could be due to an increase in the thickness 
of the adsorbed water films around the clay particles 
which fills the added void space due to the increase 
in void ratio and therefore does not affect the effect¬ 
ive void ratio to an appreciable degree.

Possibility of Forcing Liquids other than Water 

Through Solis by the use of Electrosmosis . 

In order to investigate the possibility of forcing 
liquids other than water through a soil sample by 
electrosmosis, it was deemed necessary to select a 
silty soil and thereby give an unrestricted chance 
which may be restricted in clay soils. In all these 
tests iron electrodes were used for reasons concluded 
from this research and stated in the results. 

Silt plus a small amount of very fine sand was 
mixed thoroughly in the dry state. A quantity of it 
was compacted into the electrosmosis apparatus and the 
electrodes put in place to assist in confining the 
soil. Lignosol solution (6% by dry weight) was poured 
into the cathode and anode ends of the apparatus and 
elevation of the fluid at each end adjusted so that 
there was no difference in head.. After the soil had 
become completely saturated, the direct current was 
turned on. The graph of Lignosol collected vs., time 
as shown on plate 30 indicates the constant rate of 
discharge of lignosol from cathode.. The coefficient 
of electrical permeability obtained from this test 
using lignosol is 3.07 x 10~^ cm^/sec.volt. After

sufficient readings had been obtained to plot this graph 
the lignosol was allowed to travel to the cathode and 
rise in the tube on that side until it could not raise 
its elevation any further.. The potential across the 
sample was maintained for 24 hours and at the end of 
this time the lignosol had reached a black color 
possibly due to oxidation. The sample was removed 
from the electrosmosis apparatus and saved for purposes? 
of investigation of frost heave. 

Another portion of the same sample which had 
been mixed in the dry state was compacted into the 
electrosmosis apparatus by using the same method as 
that employed in the lignosol sample. Once again the 
solution which was calgon [6% by dry weight) was poured 
into the anode and cathode ends of the apparatus. After 
the soil had become completely saturated the direct 
current was connected to the apparatus and the re¬ 
cording of necessary results yielded the graph as shown 
on plate 3Q . The coefficient of electrical permeability 
for this soil when calgon was used is 2.2 x 10 -'cm^/sec.volt. 

One very interesting result of the treating of this 
silty soil with lignosol as the liquid was that the 
sample appeared to have layers of sand then silt for

the length of the sample. This was observed, when a 
sample was being obtained for the frost room. Further 
tests will be conducted to try and confirm this. 

As it can be seen from these results it is possible 
to move other solutions besides water through soils by 
the method of electrosmosis.

Controlled. Sleotro amo si a and Frost Heave Test on. Silt 


I n.jeoted with Lignosol 3D /by Electrical Means 

A large quantity of a sand-silt mixture of soil 
was prepared for further research into the possibility 
of forcing lignosol solutions of different concentra¬ 
tions through soil samples. The gradation, curve for 
this soil used is shown on plate 31 . 

Three concentrations of lignosol BD used in this 
investigation were 10$, 20$ and 30 $ (i.e. 30 gms. 
Lignosol/100 gms. water).. In each case the dry density 
of soil was 102.7 lbs./cu.ft., the weight of soil 
used was constant and 10 volts was the applied elec¬ 
trical potential. By using this procedure the only 
apparent variable was the concentration of lignosol 
used.. 


The resulting curves of lignosol moved vs. time 
for these different concentrations are shown in plate 
32. The coefficient of electrical permeability under 
the conditions stated are shown in table 8. 

The results tabulated in table 8 indicate that the 
coefficient of electrical permeability for 10$,, 20$ 
and 30$ solutions of the lignosol used are

creasing viscosity of the transported liquid used, the 
coefficient of electrical permeability should decrease 
(all other things being constant) according to the 
theory stated. This is true for the 10 % and 20% 
solution strengths but the ~$0% solution gave a greater 
value of the coefficient of electrical permeability.. 


in order to investigate this further the following 
reasoningjwas used. The relationship exists that

Due to the analogy used between hydraulic permea¬

theory of this manuscript, it follows that

The relationship in equation A was used to 
determine the electrical permeability K e of the soil 
treated with lignosol 3D. The results as shown in 
table 8 indicate that the value of the electrical 
permeability when 10$ and 20$ lignosol were used was 
4.89 x 10~ 10 cm^/volt and 4.96 x 10” 10 cm^/volt 
respectively but when 30 $ solution was used the elec¬ 
trical permeability was 12.6 x 10~-^ cm^/volt. This 
value obtained for 30$ solution of lignosol BD is- 
approximately two and one-half times the electrical 
permeability of 10$ and 20$ solutions. The dry density 
of the soil and cross sectional area of sample as well 
as the applied potential was a constant in each case. 
The explanation of this phenomena may be found in the 
thickness of the double layer, which has been dis¬ 
cussed in the theory. Leo Oasagrande found this was

the explanation for the difference of coefficient of 
hydraulic permeability of a given soil varying as 
much as ten times with the addition of a small amount 
of salt to the water, thereby changing the concentration 
of dissolved salts in the water ( 23 ). 

For practical purposes of the use of electrosmosis 
for the injection of lignosol solutions into a soil 
which yields to frost heave conditions, this variation 
in the coefficient of electrical permeability is not as 
serious to the results of field use as it appears. This 
is due to the other unknown factors which may occur in 
the field. 

After treatment by electrosmosis the three samples 
plus an untreated sample were subjected to frost heave 
conditions in order to observe the stabilization effect 


of this electro-chemical treatment.

The samples were subjected to frost leave con¬ 
ditions for twelve days. By examination of plate 33 
it can be seen that the untreated sample heaved to 
a maximum of 11,3 % in four days, and did not heave 
any further after that time. The treated aarnples 
heaved for 10 days before coming to equilibrium. 

The maximum heave of the treated samples was only 
3.2 fo for the sample treated with 10/ solution of 
lignosol. The samples treated with 20/ and 30/ 
lignosol solutions heaved 3.0/ and 2,|j/ respectively. 
Table 9 gives information with regard to initial 
moisture content, final moisture content, initial 
dry density and percent heave for the samples 
used.

CONCLUSIONS: 


The following conclusions are based on the 
findings of the research as stated in this man¬ 
uscript : 

(1) . the Atterberg Limits of the soils tested 

are affected by electrical treatment but 
no definite trend is apparent. The soil 
in the region of the anode is affected 
to a greater degree than the soil at the 
cathode. 

(2) . the moisture content of a soil sample 

can be reduced by the use of electrosmosis; 
the maximum decrease obtained in this 
research was about 7%. 

(3) . new bedding planes can be produced in 

Dunvegan Clay Shale by electrosmosis. 

(4) . the coefficient of electrical permeability 

for Dunvegan Clay Shale, Steamboat Creek 
Clay H2 D5, Steamboat Creek Clay III D5 are 
2x 10”^cm 2 /sec volt, 3.4x 10"^ cm 2 /sec volt 
and 9.9x 10”^ cm 2 / sec volt respectively 
which is about 1000 times greater than 
the coefficient of hydraulic permeability.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: 


(1) Further research should be continued with 
respect to consolidation tests on untreated soils 
and those which have been treated by electrosmosis. 
The recommended procedure is as follows; 

a. obtain the initial moisture content of the 
sample which will not be treated and also for 
the sample which will be subjected to electr¬ 
osmo sis., 

b. the amount of expansion or contraction of 
the sample during electrosmosis should be 
determined. 

c. consolidation tests should be performed on 
the untreated and treated samples. 

d. the samples should be allowed to consolidate 
for two or three days after it has reached 
100% consolidation under a given load. 

An accurate determination of the slope and 
characteristic of the secondary compression 
branch of the time curves may then be made. 

(2) The result of the combined effect of electros- 
mosis and air pressure on the quantity of water that 
may be forced through a given soil mass per unit ol 
time should be investigated.. These results may be

compared with the results obtained when only electro 
mosis was used. 

5 Investigations to determine the different 
chemical solutions which may and which may not oe 
injected into saturated soil masses by the use of 
electrosmosis may be continued.
