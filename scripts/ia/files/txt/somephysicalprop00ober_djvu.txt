CHAPTER 


I. 


GENERAL INTRODTJC T ION. 


Th8 investigations here described all fall under the general 
title of the Physical Properties of Alberta Coals* Much work related 
to these properties of coal in general has been done in various parts 
of the world, while particular studies along these lines relating to 
Alberta coals have been in progress for several years in the labora¬ 
tories of the Research Council of Alberta. Still the field is far 
from exhausted, and much work is yet to be done. 

Several aspects of the topic have been considered, and the work 
described has been divided into three main sections. 

The first investigation dealt with the moisture holding pro¬ 
perties of Alberta coals* This was a continuation of work previously 
done in these laboratories and entaileds 

(a) The determination and redetermination of the vapor pressures 
of the saturated solutions of various salts at a definite 
temperature 

(b) The determination of the moisture holding properties of 
various samples of coal with the use of these salt solutions. 

This problem was not included in the original plan of research, 

but was necessitated by the request from the Dominion Government Fuel 

Testing laboratories in Ottawa for a cooperative investigation. 

The second investigation dealt with the wetting of coal dust

- 2 - 

by water, and involved the testing of several wetting agents now on 
the market. This work was carried out with a view toward its possible 
usefulness in coal mines for the prevention of dust explosions, and 
because the wetting of coal was required as part of the technique of 
later work. 

The third, and possibly the most important investigation, 
was concerned with very finely ground coal,sometimes called /J coal". 
The problems entailed here include: 

(a) The development of a method for evaluating the fineness 
of grinding. 

(b) The development of a method for determining the specific 
gravity of coal $ this involved the use of the wetting 
agents mentioned above. 

(c) The use of a new ball mill for comparison of fine grinding 
of coal in air and in vacuo. 

Earlier investigations in this laboratory on the oxidation of 
coal were temporarily suspended because it was found necessary to use 
finer grinding of coal than was then possible, and to have a method 
for the determination of surface exposed. The work here described will 
now permit the continuation of the oxidation studies. 

It can be seen that every stage of this Investigation is 
closely related to problems of importance to the coal industry of the 
province, and this relationship was kept in mind throughout.

CHAPTER II 

CAPACITY MOISTURE OF COAL 

1 . Intr oduction . 

The classification of coal now employed in North America,both by 
scientific workers and in commerce, involves, for the lower rank coals, 
their moisture holding character* Specifications for this classifica¬ 
tion are given by the American Society for Testing Materials under the 
heading "Classification of Coal by Rank" (l). These specifications, it 
might be noted, have been approved in Canada® 

In the above specifications, coals containing less than 69 percent 
of fixed carbon on the dry, mineral-matter-free basis, are classified by 
their heat value on their "moist" mineral matter free basis. If the 
reference to moisture had stopped at this point, it might have resulted 
in coal from a dry section of a mine being given a higher classification 
than the same coal from a wet section of the mine* The specifications 
note, however, that "moist" refers to coal containing its natural bed 
moisture but not including visible water on the surface of the coal* 

They further state that "samples containing surface moisture shall be 
brought to a standard condition of moisture equilibrium at 30 S C in a 
vacuum desiccator containing a saturated solution of K 2 SO 4 (97 percent 
humidity) as suggested by Stansfield and Gilbart" (2)* These specific 
cations ensure that free surface moisture shall have no effect on the 
evaluation of the moisture content and only the "true moisture" shall be 
considered® (Stansfield and Gilbart later adopted the term "Capacity 
Moisture" as preferable to "True Moisture")*

Early Work 


The procedure for the determination of capacity moisture of coal, 
embodied in the above A.S.T.M. specifications, is the result of a great 
deal of work, most of it dono in the laboratories of the Research Council 
of Alberta, The findings of the earlier work have been published (3) but 
later developments have not been dealt with, so space is given here for 
a brief outline of previous work by E, Stansfield, K. C. Gilbert and others, 
leading up to the determination of the capacity moisture of coals. 

In 1923 an air drying apparatus was constructed in these labora¬ 
tories (3) for the dual purpose of preparing the sample for laboratory 
handling and of evaluating the moisture holding capacity of the coal. 

Here, crushed coal was dried In a stream of air of 60 percent humidity. 

This did not provide temperature control, and as air was used, the coal 
was liable to oxidation. Consequently a new apparatus was constructed 
early in 1931 which maintained a uniform temperature of 30°G and circu¬ 
lated, instead of air, natural gas of 60 percent humidity (4). 

Other workers had been studying the relation between the moisture 
in coal and the vapor pressure of such moisture, and had made use of 
desiccators and constant“humidity solutions (5). Following along these 
lines, a vacuum desiccator method was developed in 1931 in these labora¬ 
tories for the rapid routine determination of the capacity moisture of 
a coal as an ©valuation of the bed moisture of the coal in the seam, 
unaffected by local conditions of free moisture in the mine. 

The procedure (2) is outlined as follows. A fresh coal sample is 
crushed to pass a 14 mesh screen. Weighed portions of about 5 g. each 
are placed in aluminum capsules, and two capsules with covers removed 
are placed in each of a series of desiccators. Each of these desiccators 
has in its lower compartment a saturated solution of a salt plus crystals 





- 5 - 


of the salt itself* Such a system maintains a constant humidity at a 
given temperature* The relative humidities supplied by the desiccators 
employed, range from 12 percent to 97 percent. The desiccators are 
evacuated to avoid oxidation and to speed up the attainment of equili¬ 
brium of the system. They are then placed in a constant temperature 
chamber maintained at 30°C for 48 hours. The moisture still retained 
by each portion of coal, after coming to equilibrium with the humidity 
conditions of its desiccator, is then determined by drying in a vacuum 
oven for 3 hours at 105-110°C. The values thus found are plotted against 
the corresponding relative humidities, and a curve obtained, representing 
values up to a humidity of 97 percent. The curve is then extrapolated to 
cut the 100 percent humidity line and the point of intersection taken as 
the capacity moisture of the coal. 

It was assumed by StansfieId and Gilbart "that the capacity moisture 
of the coal is the minimum amount of water in the fresh coal which can 
exert the same vapor pressure as free water at the same temperature”. 

Hence the capacity moisture, determined as described, is the moisture 
value that should be used for classification purposes. 

It was found after a large number of samples had been tested by 
this method, that the moisture retained by any coal in the desiccator con- 
taining K 2 SO 4 rarely differed notably from 0.986 times the capacity mois¬ 
ture. 0.986 was the average value found with some 69 coals. Thus a much 
simplified method of determining capacity moisture could be used. How the 
retained moisture of the coal sample in the K 2 SO 4 desiccator only was de¬ 
termined, and the value divided by 0.986 to give the capacity moisture. 
This procedure was adopted as a routine test in these laboratories in 1934 


and is still in use

3. Current Investigation . 

In 1939, however, J.K.H.Nicolls of the Fuels Division of the 

Canadian Bureau of Mines, challenged the accuracy of the factor 1 

0.986 

(1.014) and suggested the use of the factor 1.03. Accordingly a 
further investigation along these lines was started in cooperation with 
the fuel testing laboratories in Ottawa and the Pittsburgh laboratories 
of the U. S. Bureau of Mines ( £) • 

Scope. The investigation undertaken was divided into two main 
sections. First, the determination of the relative humidities obtained 
by the use of saturated solutions of various salts, and second, a deter¬ 
mination of the capacity moistures of a number of coals by both the 
graphical and calculation methods described above® 

In all, 15 salts were investigated, and the most suitable of 
these used in the determination of the capacity moistures of 54 coals. 

Similar tests were mad© on most of the coals in the above labora¬ 
tories of Ottawa and Pittsburgh® 

A proximate analysis was carried out on each of the samples in 
addition to the moisture tests, in order to check the accuracy of 
sampling by comparison with proximate analyses mad© in Ottawa® 

Determination of Relative Humiditi es. Stansfield and Gilbart 
list a number of salts with the corresponding relative humidities re¬ 
sulting from their saturated solutions as shown in table I® These were 
approximate values taken from the International Critical Tables, and ex¬ 
trapolated where necessary to 30°C. 

Later, values for the actual solutions used were determined by 
Gilbart by the measured depression of the mercury column in a barometric 
tube with the introduction of water and of the saturated salt solutions.

His results are also shown in table I. 

Gilbart lacked facilities for obtaining high accuracy, and his 
method was tedious; consequently redeterminations were made by a new 
method. 

The new method finally adopted was that of air saturation. At 
first an attempt was made to measure the moisture taken up by measured 
volumes of air over water and over the solutions of salts tested, but 
this was found to be slow and the volume measurement inaccurate. Later 
a new procedure was tried and found satisfactory. This was essentially 
the method of Washburn and Heus© for the determination of vapor pressures 
(?) but with a simplification both of apparatus and procedure. 

Air is drawn in a continuous stream through, first, a saturation 
system of water, second, a weighed drjring train, third, a saturation 
system of the desired salt solution, and fourth, a second drying train. 
The whole is maintained at a constant temperature.

The weight of moisture taken up by the air in each saturation 
system, and collected in the following drying train, depends upon the 








































- 8 - 


humidity within the saturator and the volume of air passed through. As 
the volume of air passed through in any experiment is essentially the 
same in both the water and salt saturators, the relative humidity in the 
latter can be calculated from the determined moisture weights# 

Apparatus . The apparatus consists of two saturation systems, two 
drying trains, and a suction bottle as shown in the flow diagram of 
figure 1,1. Each saturation system consists of four tubes so arranged 
that the air flow passes from end to end of each of the four tubes 
connected in series# Each tube is constructed and charged as shown in 
figure 1,2, though in the water saturation system the tubes contain only 
distilled water and glass wool. 

Glass wool in the tubes increases the surface of liquid exposed 
to the air and decreases the time required for saturation# 

Both sets of saturation tubes ar© mounted on a light wooden frame¬ 
work, which is rocked gently by an eccentric pulley arrangement run by 
an electric motor. This rocking ensures a saturated solution of the 
salt and exposure of freshly moistened surface at all times® The quantity 
of liquid and the violence of rocking are carefully regulated# 

Each drying train consists of two U-tubes filled with dehydrite# 
Figure II shows photographs of the apparatus used. 

Procedure# The tubes of both saturation systems are charged, 
connected, and placed on the framework# The whole is then placed within 
a constant temperature chamber kept at 30°C# The rocking is started and 
continued for an hour without air flow to ensure a state of equilibrium 
throughout the system# The weighed drying trains and the suction bottle 
are then connected and air is drawn through the apparatus at the rate of 
approximately half a litre per hour for from 24 to 48 hours# A constant

head is maintained by the suction bottle, and the rate of flow is regu¬ 
lated by a pinch clamp* At the end of the run, the saturation systems 
are disconnected, and approximately half a litre of dry air is drawn 
through in order to collect any moisture that might remain in the side 
arms* Finally the drying trains are weighed* 

Various precautions were taken to guard against experimental 

errors* 

Temperature in the chamber was controlled to plus or minus 0*2°C* 

Before and after each run the system was tested for air tight¬ 
ness • 

The saturated salt solutions were made with C*P® salts and dis¬ 
tilled water, as it was not thought necessary to prepare purified samples 
of the salts* The same salts were used in the work for capacity moisture 
later described* 

Salts giving a low relative humidity required the longer run of 
48 hours to give a readily weighable increase in weight to the drying 
train, while for those of higher relative humidity 24 hours was suffi¬ 
cient* 

Runs were first made with water in both saturation systems, with 
successive reductions in the rate of flow of air until concordant results 
indicated complete saturation of the air during its passage through the 
tubes* This concordance also indicated that the drop in pressure, and 
consequent increase in volume between the first and second saturation 
systems did not cause a measurable effect in the results* However, as 
a precaution, the two saturation systems were interchanged in position 
in alternate runs for everjr determination* 

Calculations * The calculation of results is simple* If X is the

increase in weight of one drying train due to the moisture taken up from 
the salt solution, and Y is the corresponding increase in the weight of the 
other drying train due to the moisture taken up from the water, then the 

percent relative humidity of the salt solution system at 30°C is X x 100.

Values Determined . Table II gives a list of the separate deter¬ 
minations and their averages® Results with several other salts which 
proved unsatisfactory for use have been excluded from the table* For 
example, potassium persulphate gave steadily decreasing values due to 
slow decomposition, and with barium nitrate, which has a relative 
humidity of over 99 %, erratic results were obtained. 

Discussion of Re sults. It will be noted that these values vary 
slightly from those determined by Gilbart. The results are reasonably 
consistent, with a maximum deviation from the average of approximately 
0*5/t and an average deviation of approximately 0®3$ of the values® 

As these values are used with moisture values whose allowable 
deviation by A.S.T.M® specifications (8) is approximately Z% 9 closer 
checking of results was not deemed necessary. 

Determination of Capacity Moisture . Capacity moisture determina¬ 
tions were carried out on 54 coals, 11 from Saskatchewan, 11 from U.S.A. 
and 32 from Alberta. Table III lists etc. samples, indicating the source 
and classification of each. These were all lower rank coals for, 
as already stated, it is these coals that are classified on the

’’moist basis” and for which a determination of capacity moisture is 
necessary* 

The procedure followed was the same as that used by Stansfield and 
Grilbart, already described,. Vacuum desiccators and controlled humidi¬ 
ties were employed, and the determined retained moisture values plotted 
against the corresponding relative humidities* 

In the first 46 determinations the salts used were lithium chloride, 
potassium acetate, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, sodium chloride, 
potassium sulphate, and potassium chlorate© In the last 8 determinations, 
potassium acetate, calcium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, sodium chloride, 
potassium chloride, barium chloride, potassium nitrate, potassium sul¬ 
phate and boric acid were used* In plotting the curves, the averaged 
values given in table II were employed. 

The primary object of the work was to check the accuracy of the assump 
tion that the retained moisture over the saturated potassium sulphate solu 
tion, for all coals, approximates 98 * 6 % of the capacity moisture found by 

extrapolation of the moisture-humidity curve© (As previously stated this

value had been challenged by Nicolls, particularly as applied to high 
moisture coals). 

Accordingly the retained moisture over the potassium sulphate solu¬ 
tion for each coal was calculated as a percentage of the capacity moisture 
as determined from the corresponding curve. As a further check, the 
capacity moisture for each coal was calculated by multiplying the potassium 

sulphate retained moisture value by 100, and the values thus obtained were 

98.6 

compared with the corresponding capacity moisture values from the curves. 

Sample Determination. The values determined for one of the coals 
is given as follows:

Determined V al ues . The retained moisture values determined for each 
sample, together with the capacity moisture values determined by extra¬ 
polation, are shown graphically in figures III to IX inclusive. These 
capacity moisture values are listed in table IV, (column 3), and compared 
with the values obtained by calculation (column 5)* The retained moisture 
of each coal over the potassium sulphate solution, expressed as a per¬ 
centage of the corresponding capacity moisture from the curves, is shown 
in column 4. 

The samples in tables and charts are arranged in order of descending 
capacity moistures for each of the divisions, Alberta coals, Saskatchewan 
coals and U.S.A. coals. 

In. order to illustrate the general trend of the moisture curves, dis¬ 
cussed later, a composite table was compiled, using the values obtained 
in the current investigation together with values from previous moisturo 
determinations made by Gilbart. The whole list of values from 119 coals 
was arranged in order of increasing capacity moistures, and grouped as 
nearly as possible in representative ranges. The retained moisture values 
for each coal at stated humidities of 20, 40, 60, 80, 90 and 97 percent, 
as shown by its curve, were expressed as percentages of the capacity 
moisture. These percentages for each group were then averaged, and these 
average values plotted against the corresponding humidities. 

The averaged values are given in table V and the curve for each group 
shown in figure X. 

The grouped averaged values for the potassium sulphate factor are also 
included in this table. 

Discussion of Results . An examination of table IV shows the accuracy 
of the calculation method for determining capacity moistures. In only

two instances is the difference between the calculated and extrapolated 
values greater than 0*5%, and these are of exceptionally high moisture 
coals• 

A study of table V shows slight confirmation of Micolls® claim that 
the potassium sulphate factor is lower for high moisture coals, as in this 
table the value for coals from 50-35% moisture averages 98*2 and for coals 
from 35-41% moisture averages 98.0* However, the average value of 93*8 
for the 54 high moisture coals tested in the current investigation, shown

in column 4 table IV, lends no support to Nicolls suggestion that for 

general use the value 98.6 previously used be reduced to 97.1 ( 100 ). 

1.03 

Table VI gives a comparison of moisture values determined in Edmon¬ 
ton, Ottawa and Pittsburgh. It will be noted that the Edmonton values tend 
to be a little higher than the others, but in general they agree reasonably 
closely, particularly in consideration of the high moisture content of most 
of the samples. 

It might be noted that there is no officially adopted standard for 
the determining of retained moisture in coarsely ground coals. In the 
Pittsburgh laboratories, moisture determinations are known to be made In 
an oxidizing atmosphere, while in Edmonton a neutral atmosphere is used. 

The latter gives higher moisture values. 

Some interesting features may be seen in the curves. The lov*rer 
moisture coals have simple curves, while the high moisture coals have dis¬ 
tinctly double curves, with a gradual change from the former to the latter 
as the moisture content of the coals increases® This is more clearly shown 
by the composite curves of figure X* 

In the lowest composite curve the capacity moistures are all below 
4^o. The retained moistures, expressed as percentages of these low capacity 
moistures, are therefore liable to large numerical errors, and no great 
significance can be attached to this curve. It might also be noted that 
all the coals in this group are bituminous coals from the Kootenay geologi¬ 
cal horizon, and that no similar coals are included in the other groups. 

Several explanations of the double curvature of the high moisture 
coals might be submitted. One suggestion is that it is caused by the hetero¬ 
geneous character of the coal, but this is improbable. Another suggestion 
is that the curve is characteristic of the manner in which moisture is held

in the coal# Thus Porter and Ralston (5) suggest that moisture may b© 
held in three ways i adsorbed on the surface, held in capillaries, and 
closely combined as a gel. This may give an explanation of the double 
curvature with the high moisture coals, as a double curvature may be noted 

in the vapor pressure - water content curve of a silica gel. Figure XI is

A silica gel with high moisture content, if slowly dried, continues 
to have practically the same vapor pressure as pure water until the mois¬ 
ture content falls to about 6 mols. of water to one mol of silica (65% 
moisture). This is the point A in the curve. At this point the capillaries 
and cells are full of water. With a continued drying, from A to B in the 
curve, the capillaries remain full of water but shrink in size, and the 
vapor pressure falls. At B the volume change stops, and with further drying

from B to C in the curve, the moisture in the capillaries is replaced by air, 
with little change in the vapor pressure. At C the capillaries only contain 
the strongly held adsorbed water. With further drying this also is removed, 
as seen from C to D in the curve, with a rapid fall of vapor pressure. 

The above explanation is in accord with the changes in transparency 
in the gel at points B and C. 

It is suggested, by analogy, that high moisture coals contain notable 
amounts of gel, while low moisture coals do not. It might be noted that 
the point A in the above curve corresponds to the capacity moisture point 
for coals.

The investigation of the various salt solutions and of their use 
in the determination of capacity moisture, showed that potassium sulphate 
can be satisfactorily employed for a high humidity. 

Boric acid has proved quite satisfactory in the tests made, and has 
the further advantage that its higher humidity { 99 %) would reduce the errors 
in computing capacity moisture. Until further tests have been made with 
boric acid, however, the potassium sulphate values will be used as before.

CHAPTER III 
WETTING AGENTS FOR COAL DUST 

1, Introduction . 

One of th9 serious problems in coal mining is the prevention of 
dust explosions* Even with modern precautionary measures the danger 
of explosions must still be recognized (10) and various means have been 
adopted to prevent them* Rock dusting has long been recognized as an 
efficient preventative measure (ll) but this process tends to aggravate 
the general dust condition* Spraying with water is a simple means of 
decreasing the dust hazard, and is advocated by Harrington and Forbes 
(12) as a measure for ^forwarding both health and safety”* Hartmann 
and Greenwald (13) in later investigations, suggest the use of both rock 
dusting and spraying, in that one supplements the other* However, water 
dries out quickly, and its protection is lost* Also, bituminous coal 
dust, which is commonly explosive, is notably difficult to wet® 

The above suggests the importance to the coal mining industry of 
methods for wetting coal dust* Tideswell and YHieeler (14) investigated 
certain wetting agents for use in spraying in mines, but the materials 
with which they worked were not available in Canada and their investiga¬ 
tion left several questions unsettled* 

An investigation of wetting agents was thought advisable for the 
added reasons that it might assist in the laboratory problem of deter¬ 
mining the specific gravity of coal, and also might possibly be used in 
methods for evaluating the fineness of grinding*

2, Materials. 

Canadian Chemical Industries were approached and submitted for 

consideration the following six samples of commercial wetting agents, 

together with descriptive literature. 

AlKanol B. A light yellow powder, readily soluble, described 
as the sodium salt of a naphthalene sulphonic acid 
derivative. 

Alkanol 3.A. Described as a less purified form of Alkanol B. 

Dupanol W.A. White flakes. Probably a sulphated higher 
fatty alcohol. 

Perninol W« A brown powder. Ho description was provided, 

Lissapol L.S.Paste. A grayish white paste. Stated in the 

literature as not being a sulphated fatty alcohol. 

Neopen S.S. A brown powder. Described as the sodium salt of 
abietene sulphonic acid. 

3. Bxper imental Tests , 

Surface Ten sion, A quantitative determination of the surface ten¬ 
sion of various concentrations of solutions of the agents was carried out. 
A Traube stalagmometer was used and the measurements made by the compara¬ 
tive drop method with water as the standard. Temperature was controlled 
at 20-25°C with the standard surface tension of water taken as 72.5 dynes 
per cm. 

It might be assumed that the greater the reduction in surface ten¬ 
sion, from that of pure water, the better the wetting power. Hence the 
salts are listed in table YII in order of descending reduction (at 1 % 

. Thty tire 

concentration). *b«L a shown graphically in figure XII. 

From an examination of figure XII it is seen that Dupanol W.A. 
lowers th9 surface tension to the greatest extent, and with the greatest 
effect at low concentrations. The curves show that concentrations greater 
than 0.5/£ have little added effect on the surface tension. The graph also

■ Rate of Wetting * A determination was 3mde of the comparative rates of 
wetting of the six materials® Throughout the tests one sample of coal dust 
was used* This was prepared from a coking bituminous coal from the Hill- 
crest collieries, very difficult to wet, having a low moisture content (of 
approximately 1.5%)and a high volatile 'matter content (of approximately 28%*) 
The sample was ground in a ball mill for two hours, and gave a screen 
analysis of 98% through 150 mesh, and 94*5% through 200 mesh* 

In a later test a sample of coal dust from Brazeau was used for com¬ 
parison of coals* This had a moisture content of approximately 1*5%, a 
volatile matter content of 16% and a screen analysis of 97% through 150 
mesh and 90% through 200 mesh*

The test used was simple. The solution to be tested was placed 

in a one inch diameter test tube and a small scoopful of dust (approx. 

0,055 g.) was dusted through a screen onto the surface. The time taken 

for the dust to be wetted and sink was measured with a stop watch. 

Ten or twelve determinations were made on each concentration of 

each wetting agent. The averaged results are shown in table VIII with 

the salts listed in the same order as in table VII, 

A blank determination was made, using distilled water, with no 

wetting observed during a period of 4 days. 

An example of a set of determinations showing the agreement of check 

results, is given as follows:

From the data of table VIII the materials were arranged in order 
of rate of wetting as follows: 1-Dupanol W.A,, 2,-Alkanol S.A., 3«Alkanol 
B, 4-Permtno2'-ir y 5-Weopen S.S., 6-Lissapol L,S,Paste. 













- 38 


This order, except for Lissapol L.S. Paste, is in agreement with 
the surface tension measurements as shovm in figure XII. 

Quantitative Tests of Wetting* Preliminary tests, made by pip^etting 
1 ml. of a given solution into a test tube containing 5 grams of coal dust, 
and determining the quantity of dust wetted after 24 hours, proved unsatis¬ 
factory. However, the results of the tests gave a number of helpful indi¬ 
cations. It appeared, first, that the wetting material was adsorbed frag, by 
the coal, and thus removed from the solution, as the top layers of the 
coal dust would be readily wet while the solution failed to penetrate to 
the lower layers; second, that the wetting materials which were more 
readily adsorbed did less actual wetting in the time allowed for the test 
than those less readily adsorbed; third, that calculated on a basis of 
grams of coal wetted per gram of material used, the solutions of lower 
concentration gave the higher results® This suggests that an unnecessarily 
high concentration of adsorbed substance on the surface of the top layers 

of the dust results from the use of the more concentrated solutions® 

7 

Bearing in mind the above indications, a satisfactory test was de¬ 
veloped and employed as follows® 

A spraying chamber, 25 inches by 10 inches and 10 inches deep was 
constructed with a removable cover and a glass observation window® The 
spray nozzle was inserted at one end, with the jet 4-5 inches from the 
end and 0«5 inches from the top® A layer of coal dustA^bout 1 mm. in 
thickness was sprinkled onto a petri dish 7 cm.®, in diameter, and the dish 
weighed with its cover. The dish without the cover, but with a guard, was 
then placed on a stand 2|r inches above the floor of the chamber. An inch 
or so of water on the floor maintained 10O/ o humidity in the chamber® 

The- solution was sprayed horizontally into the chamber and settled 









- 39 


onto the dust in the petri dish until small droplets covered the surface 
quite thickly (0*3-0*5 g.). A guard cover protected the walls of the 
dish from being wet, and only the dust received the spray* The dish was 
then removed, covered, weighed to measure the quantity of deposited spray, 
and placed in another humidity chamber containing a reservoir of water* 

This in turn was placed in a constant temperature chamber at 30°C. The 
last two precautions were taken so that neither evaporation of the spray 
nor condensation of dew would spoil the experiment* 

After standing 24 hours, the contents of the dishes were washed into 
beakers* The unwetted coal floated on the surface and was skimmed off* 

The wetted dust was collected by filtering through a weighed gooeh cruci¬ 
ble with an asbestos pad* The crucible was then dried in vacuo at 100°C 
to constant weight and the dry weight of the wetted dust thus determined* 

A blank determination ms made with no spraying to determine how 
much dust was wet by water during the operations of washing out the petri 
dishes and the skimming off of the unwetted dust* A correction was then 
calculated for each determination on the basis of the grams of unwetted 
dust handled* The results were computed to a basis of grams of dust 
wetted per gram of wetting agent, thus reducing the results for all con¬ 
centrations to a comparable basis* 

The above spraying method aimed at securing a maximum surface ex¬ 
posure to avoid the errors of adsorption mentioned in the preliminary tests. 

A series of determinations was run in triplicate, using all the 
wetting agents at various concentrations,with the averaged results shown 
in table IX. 

The same coal dust was used for this series of tests as was used 
in the "rate of wetting” tests. As a comparison of coals, the sample of 
Brazeau coal dust previously mentioned was tested, with the results in-

of wetting agent; third, that PerminolW and Lissapol L.S* Paste are dis¬

to bo the best* 

A comparison of the results with the Hillcrest and Brazeau coal 
dusts indicates that similar results are obtained with quite different 
coals, and that the wetting agents act equally well on coals of high and 
of low volatile matter content« 

Adsorption Tests . In order to demonstrate the adsorption of the 
wetting materials by the coal from the solution, the following determinations 
were made* 

(A) A measured quantity of 10 ml* of 1% Dupanol solution was placed in 

a beaker on a rotating.table, and successive 1 gram portions of dust added* 
The time taken for each additional portion to be wetted was measured by a 
stop watch* The tests were made in duplicate* 

(B) A series of beakers, each containing 10 ml. of 1% Dupanol solution, 
was set up and coal dust was added to. each, one gram to the first, two 
grams to the second, and so on* These were placed on the rotating table 
and when wetting was complete, each solution was filtered and a surface 
tension determination made on the filtrate* 

It was found that the filtering of the solutions allowed a notable 
adsorption of wetting agent by the filterpad, giving noticeably higher sur¬ 
face tension measurements than shown by 1% Dupanol in table VII* 

In (A) the first gram added gave erratic results, possibly due to 
uneven stirring* 

The results are given in table X and shown graphically in figure XIII* 

A definite similarity is seen in the two curves of figure XIII, in¬ 
dicating that the increase in wetting time was due to the increase in surface 
tension. This presumably resulted from a decrease in the concentration of 
the solution due to the adsorption of the wetting agent by the coal dust*

Rewetting . A further evidence of the adsorption of the wetting 
agents by the coal dust was given by rewetting tests* Portions of the 
Hillcrest coal dust that had previously been wetted with 1 % solutions of 
Dupanol W.A*, Alkariol 3.A* and Perminol W, were dried, exposed in the 
laboratory for a week and then tested for ”rate of wetting” as previously 
described, but with distilled water in the test tubes* The time of wetting 
was as follows: Dupanol V.A. 25 seconds, Alkanol S.A. 50 seconds, Perminol 
TIT. 60 seconds. These results when compared with those of table VIII show 
that dust, previously wetted with agents and dried, is rewetted at the 
same rate by pure water as^untreated dust by 1 % solutions. 

This was in accordance with the findings of Tideswell and fcieeler 

(14). 

Corrosion . In view of the fact that use of such agents in mine 
sprinklers might result in corrosion of rails, tools, etc., the corrosive 
action of 3% solutions of each of the wetting agents on iron was observed.

able for coal wetting; namely, Alkanol B, Neopen S.S., Alkanol S#A., 
and Dupanol W*A* For rapid and immediate wetting Dupanol W.A. is the 
best, but it is most readily adsorbed from solution and therefore will 
not wet as much dust as some of the other agents which are adsorbed less 
readily* 

Table IX indicates that for the coal dusts used and for the con¬ 
centrations of wetting agents tested, the amount of wetting was directly 
proportional to the amount of wetting agent* 

It might be noted that of the numerous commercial wetting agents 
now available (15), the six here tested were the ones suggested by Canadian 
Chemical Industries as being probably best suited for wetting coal dust* 

The following suggestions are made for the use of these wetting 
agents in mines* 

First, a solution of 0*5%, or even less, would seem to be a suit¬ 
able concentration* 

Second, after a primary thorough spraying had been carried out In 
the mine, subsequent sprayings might be done with more dilute solutions® 
This seems preferable to subsequent spraying with water alone, since later 
deposits of unwetted dust must normally be dealt with* Thus the wetting 
material might be adsorbed from the dilute solution by the fresh dust, but 
the water which was left would readily rewet the previously wetted dust 
below the fresh surface layer. 

Third, for practical application In a mine, the concentration of 
solution used, and the frequency and quantity of spraying, will depend on 
the conditions as found in the mine, such as: - fineness of dust, presence 
of dirt, and wettability of the coal* 

It is interesting to note that Wheeler (14) suggested the use of a 
3/o solution of the materials which he tested*

In regard to frequency of spraying, Wheeler’s practical tests 
indicated that for haulage roads ono spraying with the solution was ade¬ 
quate for as long as a year, with water sprays at intervals as necessary. 

If the mine conditions are such that there is a continual deposit 
of fresh coal dust, it is suggested that more frequent sprayings with a 
dilute solution would be better than Wheeler’s infrequent spraying with a 
comparatively strong solution. 

Hartmann and Greenwald {13) conducted an investigation of the use 
of wetting agents in coal mines, but their work was not published until 
after the work in this laboratory had been completed. They suggest that 
the use of wetting agents alone cannot effectively prevent mine explosions, 
but that their use greatly prolongs the effective life of a given applica¬ 
tion of rock dust. They also suggest the working face of the mine as the 
most important point for spray application, Thejr used 1% solutions for 
their laboratory tests, but suggested no particular strength of solution 
for mine use. 

Considering the experimental results from a commercial point of view 
a number of points might be noted. At a quoted price of 50 cents per pound, 
any of the 4 suitable wetting agents would completely wet a ton of minus 
200 mesh coal dust at a cost of approximately $4.00, This would be even 
less for ordinary mine conditions where the dust is not so fine. 

Expressing it in another way, the cost of 100 gallons of an 0.5/£ 
solution for spraying would be $2.50. 

It might be noted that at the time this work was carried out in this 
laboratory, the method for determining the specific surface of dusts, later 
described, had not been developed. It Is suggested that the correlation 
between the amount of wetting agents adsorbed, and the specific surface of 

the dust wetted would be of sufficient interest to warrant determination®

May, 1938 (f*o.b* Montreal) for Dupanol W. A. A recent quota¬ 
tion dated February 1941, gives a price of 20 cents per pound 
(f.o.b. Montreal) for the same material*

CHAPTER IV 

COAL - ITS PREPARATION AND MEASUREMENT. 


Introduction . 

”yu coal” is the term applied by Franz Fischer to coal so finely 
powdered that each of the particles has a diameter of 10 microns (10 jcl) 
or less* It matters little whether ”;u coal” is a suitable name or not, 
but a consideration of very finely ground coal is of evident importance. 
The decrease of particle size and the attendant increase of surface area 
when coal is ground, greatly affects many coal problems* Determinations 
of oxidation, carbonization, inflammability, solubility and so on, are 
all affected by the particle size of the coal under consideration, and 
as stated by Rosin (IS) ”the influence of particle size In fuel techno¬ 
logy. is so extensive that an exhaustive report would be impossible”, 

Franz Fischer and others (17) introduced the term ” /i coal” in a 
publication dealing with their work on extraction of coal with organic 
solvents. They claimed that in ordinary ball mill grinding a lower 
limit is reached, finer than which the coal cannot be reduced, but with 
vacuum grinding in a properly constructed ball mill a much finer product 
can be obtained. This product is their ” yu coal”. 

An investigation was undertaken in the laboratories of the Alberta 
Research Council to study fine grinding of coal, in the light of the 
above claims. 

As suggested in the general introduction, the work of this inves- 






47 


tigation fell into three main divisions, which, though intimately con¬ 
nected, are described in separate sections: 

Section A* The determination of the specific gravity of coal. 

Section B* The evaluation of fineness of grinding. 

Section C. The fine grinding of coal* 

SECTION A 

THE DETERMINATION OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF COAL 

Intr o due t i on. 

A determination of the specific gravity of coal is required for 
practical commercial reasons as well as for laboratory tests* In order 
to measure the potential output of a coal mine, the mine operator must 
know the specific gravity of the coal* The specific gravity must also 
be known for coal washing operations* 

For such purposes the ''apparent" specific gravity of the coal is 
determined* This is regarded as the specific gravity of the coal in lumps 
as it occurs in the seam, and is found by weighing lumps of coal in air 
and in water. This is of course only an approximate measure of the 
specific gravity of the coal in the seam, because of the difficulty in 
securing truly representative lumps of coal* 

The determination of the real specific gravity of the coal sub¬ 
stance is far more difficult because of the gas present in the cells and 
cavities of the coal. Various means of dealing with this problem have been 
tried, "with doubtful success* Drakeley and Jones (18) saturated lumps of 
coal by boiling them in water to remove the gases, but this method obviously 
is unsatisfactory (19)* 

Many determinations of both apparent and real specific gravities 
have been made in the laboratories of the Alberta Research Council, prior 
to the current investigation* Correlations of the moisture and ash content

to the apparent specific gravity (20) of a large number of coals have been 
made, but the determinations of the real specific gravity have been some¬ 
what in doubt* 

The procedure used was as follows* The coal was ground very finely 
to liberate most of the gas and the specific gravity found by displacement 
of water in a pycnometer bottle* The air was removed by boiling, evacua¬ 
tion, or centrifuging* The best results were obtained by pumping all the 
gas possible out of the coal before the water was admitted, but even so, 
the method was not satisfactory* Furthermore many coals are difficult to 
wet by water* Organic liquids were tried in place of water, but with 
actual or suspected solvent action and change of the coal substance* Kero¬ 
sene was the best of those tried* 

A method has now been developed in these laboratories, using the 
wetting agents described in Chapter III* 

Procedure. 

The coal to be tested is finely ground in a ball mill* A solution 
of a suitable concentration of wetting agent in water is prepared, and its 
specific gravity determined® Centrifuge tubes of approximately 50 ml* capa¬ 
city, containing about 25 ml* of the solution, are weighed, about 3 to 4 
grams of the finely ground coal added, and the tubes reweighed* The coal 
is readily wet and sinks to the bottom* The tubes are almost filled with 
the solution, and are then centrifuged for 10 minutes at approximately 

thf C«d fro"' 

2000 r.p*m* (diameter of swing s 20 inches)* This clears A the solution in 
the neck of the tube ; and tends to force the solution into any of 

the capillaries of the coal not already filled® After centrifuging the 
tubes are filled to the mark of known volume and weighed* 

The weight of the solution displaced is calculated from the specific

gravity of the solution, the volume of the tube, and the weight of the 
coal, suid from this the specific gravity of the coal is calculated. 

For most of the coals tested a concentration of 0.3?S solution of 
Dupanol was found suitable, but for some of the coals more difficult to 
wet, a 0.5?6 solution was necessary#

Discu ssion. 

The specific gravity determinations carried out at this time were 
for use in the evaluation of fineness of grinding, and only three figure 
accuracy was required. For more accurate determinations a tube with a 
narrow neck would be required, so that the volume could be more accurately 
measured. 

A number of interesting features were noted in the determinations. 
When a sample of coarse coal (14-20 mesh) was used, a swelling effect was 
noted after centrifuging. That is, if the tubes were filled to the mark 
and left standing for a few hours, the liquid rose above the mark, but on 
recentrifuging the liquid receded to the mark. This phenomenon was not 
noted with the finely ground coal. This suggests that the coarse coal still 
contains considerable gas in the pores and capillaries, which is compressed 
by centrifuging, and slowly expands on standing. 

It was also noted that there was a slight increase in the specific 
gravity determined on a given sample of coal, with continued grinding. An

ash analysis of portions of the sample taken at intervals of grinding 
showed that this increase in specific gravity was not due to iron from 
the balls and mill, as the percentage of ash remained constant* This also 
would indicate that the finer grinding released more of the gas* 

The method was found to be quiok and simple, and with some modifi¬ 
cations might be suitable for a standard determination of the real specific 
gravity of coal* 

SECTION B 

EVALUATION OF FINENESS OF GRINDING 
Introduction^ 

As suggested above, the fineness of grinding has a great effect 
upon various processes and reactions with coal. Therefore the results of 
experiments with coal must be correlated to an actual measure of fineness* 
This is ©specially true with very finely ground or powdered coal (21). 
Actually it is the surface exposed that is important, but the determina¬ 
tion of particle sis© and surface area may b® dealt with as one problem* 

Various general methods for determining particle sis© are here de¬ 
scribed, with a discussion of their suitability for us© with coal* 

Scre ening* This is the universal method for sizing materials (22), 
but is limited to available sizes of screen openings, and the finest screen 
ordinarily used is the 200 mesh, with an opening of 0*074 mm* (Tyler Stan¬ 
dard)* This is not fine enough for experimental work with coal, as the 
surface area of the sub«screen sizes may far outweigh that of the screened 
sizes. 

Screen analyses of the larger sizes of a ground material may be 
extrapolated by means of equations to give the size of the finer particles 
(23), but this method is subject to the general errors of extrapolation. 














- 























-

- 51 


and corrections for particle shape must be applied* Such extrapolation 
methods are only applicable to fairly homogeneous substances, and the 
heterogeneous nature of coal makes then unsuitable* 

Sedimentation * Particles through 200 mesh may be measured by 
rates of sedimentation and calculations based on Stokes® Law* This re¬ 
quires a suitable medium, with attendant difficulties where coal is con¬ 
cerned, for as mentioned previously, coal is not readily wet with water 
and use of organic liquids may result in solvent action* 

In any case the sedimentation method is tedious and none too 
accurate, and is only satisfactory with particles of uniform size and 
shape* 

Elutriation by either air or liquid suspension is subject to the 
same objections as sedimentation, and although the method is applicable 
to particles finer than can be measured by sedimentation, the difficulties 
when applied to coal are too great for satisfactory use* 

Hydrometer Method * There have been recent developments in wet 
mechanical analysis, culminating in the "Hydrometer Method" of Buoyoucos 
(24)* The determination is a direct hydromster measurement of the den¬ 
sity of a suspension of fine particles after successive time intervals 
of settling* Such analysis measures the separation of any granular 
material into several fractions of different grain size, or gives the in¬ 
direct determination of the whole grain size distribution* 

It might be noted that this procedure is used in the soils work of 
the Agriculture Department of this University, and a modification developed 
by Casagrande (25) is used by the Department ©f Civil Engineering* 

These methods, though seemingly satisfactory for soils work, are 
not suitable for coal, due to the difficulty of wetting, and the uncer¬ 
tainty due to the buoyancy effect of the gas enclosed in the capillaries

of the coal. 

Microscope Method . The method of measuring particle size accepted 
as being the most accurate is microscopic examination. The objections to 
this method are the time required and the tediousness of the determina¬ 
tion coupled with the difficulty of securing a representative field for 
examination* As the field is extended the work increases to such an 
extent as to prohibit the use of the microscope for a practical determina¬ 
tion of particle size* 

The microscope is suitable for checking purposes, however* 

An optical method (26) for determining the area of particles might 
be mentioned* A photocell is so arranged that shadows cast by the parti¬ 
cles vary the amount of light that falls on the cell* It is reported as 
being suitable to sizes down to 8 microns in diameter* but entails the 
use of a rather complicated apparatus, and its applicability to coal dust 
is doubtful. 

Bulk-density Method * When coal is ground in a ball no.ll its bulk® 
density visibly decreases* Sinnatt and Slater (27) used this fact in a 
method for determining the fineness ©f grinding ©f coal. They determined 
the weight of a standard volume ©f coal dust to give a ’’fineness figure” 
for each coal sample* This method, however, allowed for no comparison 
between different samples, and was at best only a comparative measure ©f 
fineness* 

It would appear that none of the above mentioned methods is suit- 
able for the determination of the particle size of finely ground coal* 

A method has been developed during this investigation which gives 
a measurement of the specific surface of coal dust, which can b© taken as 
a measure of the fineness of grinding* If the average particle size is

desired, it is necessary to assume a shape factor* 


Determination of Specific Surface . 

Developm e nt of the Method * The method is based upon an equation 
relating specific surface and permeability, deduced by Kozeny (28) from 
purely theoretical considerations* The original work of developing th© 
method was done by Carman (29)* He reviewed the more reliable data for 
the permeability of granular beds in the light of Kozeny’s equation, and 
showed that experiment and theory were in extremely good agreement* 

The ’’permeability” is defined as the linear rate of flow of 
liquid through a bed under unit hydraulic gradient, and by D’Arcy’s law, 
the linear rate of flow through a porous medium is proportional to the 
pressure gradient across the bed® 

Expressed as an equation K ® Q ® L

It should b© noted that So * S 4- (l«e) where S 38 surface area per

In a second paper (30) Carman describes a thurough experimental 











- 54 


investigation of the applicability of Kozeny’s equation to granular 
materials* He tested the effect of varying particle shape, viscosity, 
porosity, head of liquid and depth of bed* As mediums he used such 
liquids as water, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, ethyl alcohol 
and ether* He also made tests with air* 

He found one limiting factor, - the equation holds only for condi¬ 
tions of streamline flow, the criterion being that Q + AVS is less than 2* 
However, for all ordinary experimental conditions he found the equation 
valid* 

Carman also tested the accuracy of the experimental results by 
using materials ©f measured specific surface, and found that the error 
did not exceed 5 - 4^. This is probably far in advance of the accuracy 
of the systems cited for measuring particle size of irregular particles* 

In this second paper Carman describes work with a minimum size ©f 
0*1 mm, diameter, but in a third paper (31) he describes tests down to 
an average particle size of 2-3 /a* He found that the method was accurate 
to plus or minus 5 %, regardless of the shape and size distribution ©f the 
particles. 

Carman®s conclusions ar© verified in general by the work of 
Wiggins, Campbell and Maagg (32) who measured the specific surface ©f 
fibrous materials by this method* 

CURRENT INVESTIGATION 

An investigation was carried out in these laboratories, with 
Carman’s work as a basis, to determine if the permeability method could 
be used to measure the specific surface of coal dust* In his later work 
Carman mentioned having used air in place of the usual liquids, but gave 
no details* However, in view of the difficulty of using liquids

with coal, it was decided to try to adapt Carman’s method, to the use of 
air. 

Apparatus and Procedure . 

The apparatus used is shown in figures XIV, XV and XVI. The per¬ 
meability cylinder first used was number 1 in figure XVI, but later this 
was replaced by number 2. 

The following procedure is applicable to both. 

A weighed quantity of dust is placed in the permeability cylinder 
A, and packed and levelled by tapping, or later by the use of a plunger. 
Air is drawn through the bed of dust in A at a constant rate, controlled 
by a constant head, which can b© varied by adjustment of F. The manometer 
B measures the pressure drop through the bed, while the manometer E 
measures the pressure inside the bottle G. The fritted glass bubbler D 
gives very fine air bubbles, and thus prevents the pulsations of the 
liquid in the manometer B. The thermometer H measures the temperature 
of the system. 

The time taken t© collect a given volume of water in the volu¬ 
metric flask G is measured by a stopwatch. For most of the determinations 
a burette was used in place of the volumetric flask. 

When samples of dust which had been previously dried were tested, 
dry air was drawn through the cylinder, as moisture adsorbed by the coal 
might change the permeability of the bed. 

For dusts finer than 200 mesh, a suitable thickness of bed was 
2-4 cm., but for coarser particles a greater depth of bed was necessary 
for accurate results. 

Method of Calculation. 

The volume of air drawn through the bed of dust is calculated from 
the volume of water collected in G, with allowances for the air pressure

and the water vapor pressure in C. This volume is calculated to the mean 
pressure of the bed, and, divided by the time recorded by the stopwatch, 
gives the M Q n of D’Arcy’s equation. The area of cross-section M A’ ! and 
the depth of ”L H of the bed are measured, and "h ft , the pressure drop across 
the bed, is expressed in terms of the fluid flowing through the bed. Thus 
the premeability "K” is calculated according to the equation

The specific gravity of the dust was calculated by the method de¬ 
scribed in Section A. 

The average particle size can only be calculated from the specific 
surface by assumptions as to sphericity. If the particles are spheres.

the average diameter would be equal to 6 * So cm., but for particles of 
irregular shape a "sphericity” factor must be applied. 

Gaudin (33) defines the degree of sphericity of a particle as the 
ratio of the surface of a sphere which has the same volume as the particle 
to the actual surface of the particle. He lists the sphericities of 
various naturally occurring particles of definite shapes, which range from 
1.00 for a sphere to 0.22 far flat disks of mica, and suggests that for 
particles encountered in mineral dressing problems the sphericities would 
be of the order of 0.5 to 0.7. 

It was found difficult to determine the sphericity of coal dust 
even with microscopic examination, but in the writer’s opinion the spheri¬ 
city is probably within the above limits of 0.5 to 0.7. 

Determinations of Specific Surface 

The first determinations of specific surface were made using the 
fritted glass filter tube (fig. XVI) as the permeability cylinder. It was 
soon found that a variable correction had to b© mad© for the resistance 
to air flow of the fritted glass. 

Accordingly a series of runs was made with the empty cylinder to 
determine the pressure head required for various rates of flow. The 
pressure head was then plotted against the linear rate of flow to give 
a correction curve for the fritted glass* 

The values determined are listed in table XI and the correction 
curve shown in figure XVII. 

As shown by figure XVII th© correction ’’curve" is actually a 
straight line, indicating the accuracy of the measurements of both pressure 
head and rate of flow. 

For all subsequent determinations with the fritted glass tube, the

Specific surface determinations were first made on samples of 
sand previously sized by screening. 

For each sample of material a number of runs was made to check 
the constancy of results with variations ©f conditions. Thus with on© 
weight of sample and porosity of bed the rate ©f flow would be measured 
for two or three different pressure heads to check the premeability. 

Then a different weight of sample with, in general, a slightly different 
porosity would be used, with variations in pressure head as before. 

Results of these determinations are given in table XII. 

Determinations were also mad© on a sample of Ottawa sand, a sample 
of ore dust, and a sample of Br&zeau coal dust sized to 150=»200 mesh. 
Results for these determinations are also shown in table XII. 

The determinations of specific surface were in fair agreement, but 
the deviations were too great for satisfactory results. It was thought 
that these deviations were psobably due to errors in measuring the dim@n« 
sions of the bed. 

The large specific surface of the Brazeau coal dust was thought 
to indicate a very low sphericity. However, this was partially explained 
later by microscopic examinations which showed that the sample contained

a fair percentage of particles of minus 200 mesh size. 

At this time some recent work of Lea and Nurse (34) was first 
noted. They also had adapted Carman’s method to use air. Their permea¬ 
bility cylinder seemed better suited to this work than the fritted glass 
tube, and with a few minor changes was adopted as shown in figure XVI, 
cylinder 2. 

The bed of dust in this cylinder is supported by a filter paper 
on a perforated disk. The dust is packed uniformly by rotating the 
plunger, and the depth of bed is measured accurately by a vernier scale 
that can be attached to the plunger• 

It was found that for measurements of permeability of fine dust 
no correction was required for the resistance of the filter paper to any 
air flow used. 

Details of a sample determination follow. 

Samples Edmonton coal dust, air dried, ground 70 hours 
in a special ball mill.

Four separate runs, with varied conditions, were made in this 
apparatus with each dust tested. These four runs could be completed in 
two hours or less, depending on the rate of air flow advisable. The 
tests could be mad© on from 5 to 20 grams of material, an amount far less 
than that required for screen analysis. 

Repeat determinations were mad© on ordinary sand, Ottawa sand 
and Brazeau coal dust with results shown in table XIII. Determinations 
were also don© on Edmonton coal dust screened to 150-200 mesh, and on 
the very finely ground coal dusts d@scr5.bed in Section C, with representa¬ 
tive results also shown in table XIII. 

The results are described later, but they show in brief, smaller 
deviations than with the earlier apparatus, and no increase in deviations 
in tests with very fine dust. 


Examination by Microscope . 

Some microscopic examinations were carried out on various dusts 
to obtain some comparison with the specific surface measurements® Magni¬ 
fication of 1200 was used, with an oil immersion objective. The scale 
of the micrometer eyepiece was calibrated with a micron gauge to permit

direct sise readings; one scale division represented approximately 2 
microns. 

No satisfactory comparison could b© made, due to the difficulty 
in securing a representative field. The larger particles, such as the 
150-200 mesh sand, were dusted directly onto the slide. With coal dust, 
the best results were obtained by forming a dilute suspension of the dust 
in alcohol, shaking, and quickly transferring a drop of the suspension 
onto a slide. The alcohol on drying left a fairly representative field 
of particles for examination. 

It was found that the coal dust supposedly sized by screening to 
150-200 mesh still contained a fair percentage of minus 200 mesh particles, 
thus at least partially accounting for the abnormally high specific sur¬ 
face measurements of the permeability tests. It was also noted that in 
the ordinary minus 200 mesh dusts, particle sizes ranged approximately 
from 1 to 100 microns. However, the percentages of particle sizes varied 
from sample to sample, as was indicated by the specific surface measure¬ 
ments. In the most finely ground dust obtained, a few particles of 10-20 



































- 65 - 


microns were still observed, although most of them were less than 5 microns* 

This is illustrated in the photographs of figure XVIII. Photograph 
1 is a picture of the field of a dust which had a specific surface of 
11,400 sq.cm, (or a particle size of 8.5 microns diameter, if the spheri¬ 
city = 0.6), while the dust of photograph 2 had a specific surface of 
21,300 sq.cm, (and a particle size of 5 microns diameter, if the spheri¬ 
city ■ 0.6). Both photographs show a range of sizes, but the percentage 
of small particles is much greater in the second dust that had nearly 
twice the specific surface. 

It might be noted that the coal dust particles gave an appearance 
of fairly regular shape quite similar to that of sand. 

A comparison of approximate sizing is given in table XIV.

Sphericity . 

The Tyler screens of 100 and 150 mesh have openings of 0.147 and 
0.104 mm. The specific surface of spherical particles of the mean size 
of 0.125 mm, is 482 sq.cm. Similarly the value for 150 - 200 mesh screens 


is 674 sq.cm.

From this, the sphericity of the sand, given by the specific surface 
as determined is 0*71 and 0*72 for the two sizes respectively* For the 
Edmonton coal dust sized to 150-200 mesh the sphericity would be 0.485, 
while for the Brazeau dust of the same size it would be 0#361# 

In the consideration of these sphericities, possible interference 
due to incomplete screening should not be forgotten, nor the fact that 
the mean diameter of particles of different screenings will not always 
approximate the mean between the limiting screen apertures# With particles 
of irregular size the smallest diameter may be the controlling factor in 
screening, so that it is possible for particles to pass through a screen 

averJ/e 

opening smaller than the*diameter# 

It might be noted that the numerical data indicates a sphericity 
of coal of less than 0*5, but in view of the above uncertainties, and the 
fact that microscopic examination suggests a regular shape tending toward 
cubical, a sphericity of 0#6 will be taken until further information is 
obtained# 

The averaged values from table XIII, for some of the materials tested, 
have been collected in table XV with data to show the effect of different 
sphericity assumptions on the calculated mean diameter* 

Finenes s Factor Comparison* 

Determinations of specific surface were made on 5 samples of coal 
mine dust to compare the results with the fineness factors computed from 
the screen analyses by the U*S.Bureau of Mines method (35)# 

The determined specific surfaces of these dusts were found to vary 
as much as from 1#3 to 1#8 times the numerical values of the corresponding 
calculated fineness factor# This is not surprising as the fineness factor 
does not take cognizance of variations in size of the minus 200 mesh

* The average diameter is calculated, assuming the sphericities shown* 
material. 

It is suggested that specific surface would be a better guide to 
relative inflammabilities of mine dusts than is the fineness factor* More- 
over the former can be more quickly determined* 

Discussion of Results * 

The slightly higher measurements of specific surface given by the 
second permeability cylinder indicate some constant error in one or both, 
but the general agreement is good* 

The concordance of sets of results throughout, even for the very fine 
dusts, indicates the high degree of relative accuracy obtainable with the 
second cylinder and this method* 

The concordance of sets of results throughout, even for the very fine 






















- 69 


dusts, indicates the high degree of relative accuracy obtainable with the 
second cylinder and this method* 

The difficulties of proving the absolute accuracy of the method are 
great* However, comparisons with screen sizings and with microscopic 
examinations indicate at least a general agreement, while the measurements 
of sphericity for sand agree with accepted values* 

Lea and Nurse (34) report agreement of check results by air permea¬ 
bility similar to those obtained in this investigation. They show also 
that other gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbon idoxide are suit¬ 
able. They give a comparison of specific surface measurements made by 
the air permeability method and by a sedimentation method, and show good 
agreement down to 5 microns* Belov/ that they suggest that the sedimen¬ 
tation method is not reliable. 

Conclusions . 

This method appears to afford a convenient and simple means for 
measuring surface area of dusts, a measurement of considerable importance 
in many fields, although it does not give a particle size distribution* 

The development of this method thus opens up a whole new field of 
investigation, especially with respect to the correlation of the re¬ 
actions of finely ground coal with its surface area*

SECTION C 
FINE GRINDING OF COAL 

Introduction . 

For routine laboratory testing of coal a sample must merely be 
crushed to pass a 250 micron sieve* This is usually done by grinding in 
an Abbe'ball mill* However, for such work as investigations of oxida- 

a it of 

tion, extraction, and solubility, Fischer (17) suggested A a special type 
of vacuum ball mill, indicating that in an ordinary ball mill, coal can 
only be ground to a certain fineness. 

On the basis of this "ultimate fineness" an investigation of oxida¬ 
tion of coal had been started in the laboratories of the Research Council 
of Alberta, assuming a coal ground to this "ultimate fineness" as a 
standard with which to work. Results indicated, however, that this 
final point was never reached, so further investigation was postponed 
until a method of evaluating the fineness of grinding could be developed. 

In preparation for further investigation a ball mill patterned after 
Fischer’s /a mill was designed and constructed, and was put into use 
when the current investigation of p. coal was started. 

M Ball Mill* 

This was of a type of a single row of balls running in a groove as 
shown in figure XIX. A photograph of the assembled mill is shown in 
figure XX. The mill was made of a standard commercial ball race, and 
the hard steel balls employed were those supplied for this ball race. 

The ball race was clamped between two steel plates held together by 12 
bolts. A hand hole in one plate was closed with a cover plate centered 
by 4 pins. One end of the axle was attached to one steel plate, while 
the other end passed through the cover plate and was used as a bolt to

tighten the latter in position. One end of the axle was hollow to allow 
for evacuation of the mill when desired* The mill was driven by a chain 
and sprocket wheel and was provided with ball bearings* Gaskets and 
packing were provided as required for air tightness* The balls were 1 5/8 
inches in diameter and weighed about 285 grams* 

By its design the mill grinds by rolling and crushing without the 
percussion effect of the ordinary Abbe mill* Not more than five balls, 
however, could be employed without tumbling under the conditions of use* 

For grinding in vacuo a packing gland was arranged at H, connected 
by a metal tube to a mercury vapor pump backed by a vacuum oil pump* 

The mill was suitably mounted, and was driven by an electric motor 
at the rate of 42 r*p.m* 

Procedure * 

The coal used for the grinding test was a sample from the Beverly 
mine, Edmonton, sized to 8«14 mesh* The coal had an ash content of 11*\% 
and was air dried to a moisture content of 7*5%* 

made 

A charge of 50 grams was used in each run, and runs*of 10,20, 30, 

50 and 70 hours grinding in air* 

Specific surface determinations were made on the product of each run, 
using the method described in Section B* 

The results are given in table XV and shown graphically in figure 

XXI. 

Grinding in Vacuo. 

A series of grinding tests were then mad© with the ball mill evacuated. 
At first it appeared that the evacuation had some small beneficial effect 
on the grinding,, but in tests with a semi-anthracite coal of low moisture 
content, no effect was observed.

*Note: As investigations of sphericity had not been made at 
the time the grinding curve of figure XXI was plotted, the 
values shown are calculated on the basis of a sphericity *= 1.0. 


This indicated that possibly the evacuation was beneficial mainly 
because it removed moisture from the coal, and thus increased its 
grindability® Moisture determinations of portions taken at intervals 
during grinding supported this view® 

A 250 g® sample of the Beverly coal was then thoroughly dried in a 
vacuum oven for 3 hours at 108 e C. Then to prepare a homogeneous sample 
and to save time in later test grinding, the dry coal was pre-ground for 
25 hours in an Abbe ball mill® 

On© 50 gram portion was then placed in the /i mill and ground for 
10 hours in air, while a second 50 gram portion was ground in the same 
mill with a vacuum of only 0.06 mm® pressure. 

Specific surface determinations were made on both products with 


results as follows

Those results show no advantage in grinding in vacuo. 

Grindability of Types of Coal . 

Tests were then made to indicate the relative ease of grinding of 
types of coal. Four coals were selected for grinding - a semianthracite 
coal from the Cascade area, a medium volatile bituminous coal from the 
Mountain Park area, a high volatile C bituminous coal from the Lethbridge 
area, and a subbituminous C coal from the Edmonton area. 

A 50 gram sample of each was ground for 50 hours in air in the p 
mill, and specific surface determinations were made on the product. The 
results are shown in table XVI.

These results indicate no great difference in grindability of these 
types of coal.

classification. That is ,a a Cascade coal with 3% moisture would appear 
almost a paste, while an Edmonton coal with 3% moisturo would appear dry. 

As naturally occurring in the mines, a Cascade coal would contain 
less than 1% moisture, a Mountain Park coal about 1%, a Lethbridge coal 
about 10%, and an Edmonton coal about 20%. 

Abra sion of Mills. 

In investigations of finely ground coal it is essential that the 
grinding treatment should not contaminate the sample and thus change the 
analysis. In the regular work of the laboratory, where Abbe porcelain 
ball mills are used, with very hard "chromang" iron balls, no detectable 
increase of ash has been found. However, in some mills the reverse is 
the case. 

A private communication from the Coal Research Laboratory of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology at Pittsburgh said that when using a 
rubber lined pebble mill,with balls or rods of steel,to produce coal, 
there was a notable increase in ash. They ground the coal under water 
containing dilute alkali - presumably to overcome the difficulty of 
wetting. In a typical run, 750 grains of coal was ground, with 25,000 
ml. of water containing 1.5 grams of caustic soda, for 72 hours at a 
speed of 50=*60 r.p.m. The ash increased from 7.6 to 9.1%. 

It is of interest to note that ”no careful measurements on surface 
or exact sis© were made*’, but the product was examined microscopically. 

In a test with the jo. mill here, where 50 grams of coal were ground 

for 70 hours at 42 r.p.m., the determined ash percentages on a dry coal 

basis were 11.7 at the start, and 11.8 at the end. This mill has been 

or 

operated for some 800 hours, and shows no visible wear of either race A ^f

Discussion of Results of Section C . 

The curve of figure XXI indicates that Fischer’s claim for an 
"ultimate fineness" of coal dust is doubtful and explains the findings 
in this laboratory during the oxidation wort mentioned in the introduc¬ 
tion to Section C. 

The tests of vacuum grinding definitely show no effect on fineness 
of grinding from evacuation per se, but it was found that moisture content 
has a notable effect and evacuation of the mill doe 3 dry coals containing 
moisture. 

From the result of the 25 hours pre-grind of the dry Edmonton coal 
in the Abbe' mill, it would appear that an ordinary ball mill will give 
as fine a product as the /i mill* 

For work on oxidation, study of occluded gases in coal, and for 
other work where it is important that the coal should not be exposed to 
air before test, use of the u mill will be essential. It is also im¬ 
portant that this mill does not contaminate the coal during grinding. 

General Conclusions of Chapter IV . 

The Permeability method of determining specific surface appears 
to' be a practical method for evaluating the fineness of grinding of 
coal, and provides a suitable measure to which various reactions and tests 
of ja coal can be related. 

The investigations described have provided the necessary foundation 
for a future study of finely ground coal. It opens up a large field of 
work relating the surface area to oxidation, solubility, extraction and 
so on. 

Grindability tests may now be measured accurately. A study of

occluded gases may be made, using a modification of the /a mill-evacuation 
set up. Colloidal coal might also be investigated* 

The importance of finely ground coal is shown in many recent reports. 
Fischer (17) greatly increased his extraction yield by using /u coal. 
Juettner and Howard (36) using /i coal for distillation in vacuo got larger 
yields than with coarse coal* Asbury (37) greatly increased the rate of 
solvent action by using yu coal, while Landan and Asbury (38) found that 
p. coal gave a greater ultimate yield than did coarse samples with solvent 
extraction* (None of these investigators gave measurements of the surface 
area or particle size of the coals they studied)• 

All of these reports indicate the importance of investigations of 
/x coal and its related problems*
