The writer wishes to express his appreciation for the 
assistance received during the preparation of this study. 

The helpful advice and suggestions for the preparation of 
the questionnaires and for writing the first draft of the 
thesis by Mr. H. T* bparby, Dr, A. vu heeves and Mr. A. w. K, 
isriksson are gratefully acknowledged, special thanks are due 
to Dr. K. b. Baker who served, part time, as one member of the 
thesis committee when that became necessary. The writer also 
expresses his gratitude to Mr, Michael Bkuba who assisted in 
distributing questionnaires to parents; and to all the prin¬ 
cipals, teachers and parents who completed the questionnaires, 
as requested, and made this study possible. 




ABSTRACT 


The purpose of this study was i^l) to ascertain the 
current practices in noon-hour supervision in Alberta central¬ 
ized schools; (2) to obtain reactions of classroom teachers 
and parents to various problems of noon-hour supervision; and 
{3) to suggest how centralized schools mi^t best handle the 
problem of noon-hour supervision. 

Three sets of questionnaires were developed as instru¬ 
ments for collecting data. Ninety questionnaires were sent to 
principals of schools in all parts of Alberta; one hundred and 
twenty were sent to teachers of centralized schools in ten 
selected school divisions; and one hundred were distributed 
to selected parents of two centralized school districts. Over 
ninety-three per cent returns were received in each case. 

The questionnaires sent to principals sought informa¬ 
tion on the following: purposes of noon-hour supervision; 
arrangements for supervising the school and playgrounds, 
lunch rooms, indoor activities, and sports; arrangements for 
allowing conveyed students to go up town at noon; type of 
equipment and accommodation available; and methods used to 
obtain staff co-operation for noon-hour supervision. 

The questionnaires sent to teachers were designed to 
reveal the nature of their duties; the time spent in carrying 
out these duties; complaints regarding noon-hour duties; and 
opinions on ten problems inherent in noon-hour supervision. 

iv 









The questionnaires sent to parents sought to determine 
whether they favored hot lunches in school; whether they would 
take turns to prepare such lunches, and supervise the play 
activities of the elementary pupils; and their opinions on 
ten problems related to noon-hour supervision. 

The findings from the questionnaires and a critical 
review of the related literature formed the bases of this 
study. The findings from the questionnaires sent to prin¬ 
cipals revealed that almost all schools had a working arrange¬ 
ment for noon-hour supervision. However, in a considerable 
number of these schools the supervision of indoor activities, 
sports, and lunch rooms could not be considered adequate when 
compared with practices recommended in the literature, in 
this respect, the facilities for preparing hot lunches were 
practically non-existent. Moreover, the findings indicated 
that supervision emphasized order and discipline more than 
socialization among pupils. 

rhe findings from the questionnaires sent to teachers 
revealed that although most teachers accepted noon-hour duties 
willingly, many felt that the noon-hour programs in their 
schools were inadequate and, as a result, few children had 
worthwhile things to do. Most teachers felt that the time 
they spent on noon-duty was reasonable, but some complained 
that they were required to spend up to five hours per week, 
borne other complaints listed by the teachers were the result 
of lack of co-operation between staffs and principals.

The findings from the questionnaires sent to parents 
indicated that the majority of them favored hot lunches in 
school and that about one-third of them were prepared to 
assist in preparing hot lunches. However, only two parents 
volunteered to supervise play activities of elementary pupils. 
Most parents felt that noon-hour activities were desirable, 
and the majority of them indicated that they would support 
spending more money on games and equipment. 

On the basis of the literature reviewed and the re¬ 
plies to the questionnaires, the following nine recommenda¬ 
tions are presented: 

1. The noon-hour program should be planned early in the 
school year, every year, by the staff and pupils. 

2. Most of the activities, if not all, should be scheduled. 

3# The noon-intermission should be not less than one and 

one-half hours long. 

4. All teachers should be available for supervision, includ¬ 
ing the principal. 

3. Adequate steps should be taken to protect pupils from 
accidents and to protect school property. 

6. Parents should be kept informed of the noon-hour program. 

7* responsible students should be asked to assist teachers 
with routine noon-hour duties. 

8. Hating lunch should be considered one of the most important 
noon-hour activities. 

3. The whole staff should participate in developing and stat¬ 
ing the purposes of the noon-hour program.

THE PROBLEM AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED 


Int redact Ion to the Problem 
Tha centralization of schools in Alberta in recent 
years has created some urgent problems in noon^hour super¬ 
vision. Many pupils bring their lunches to school and are 
left with free time during the noon-hour. Some pupils will 
use this time for study; some will gather for noisy conversa¬ 
tion. ”Many others, bored and restless, will go looking for 
’things* to do. And often as not, they'll start running 
around the halls and rooms, causing disturbances and upset¬ 
ting the school routine.”^ 

What should be done with a large group of children 
during the noon-hour? What kind of supervision is necessary? 
How many teachers should be on duty? What can be done about 
the teachers* resentment to such duties? 

It is suggested in the literature that: 

Present day lunch period systems fall, in the main, 
into two categories—the “turn 'em loose and let ’em 
run” and the “sweat ’em out“ approaches. The first 
approach is characterized by a short eating period 
followed by turning the children out on the playground 
en masse to shift for themselveso Members of the teach¬ 
ing staff strive desperately to provide some kind of

supervision under impossible conditions. In large 
schools hundred of pupils will be milling about at 
this time under the **watchful eye” of the completely 
harassed duty teachers. The defects of this answer 
to the lunch period problem are obvious: poor super¬ 
vision of pupils, lack of organized play activities, 
development of poor play habits and eating habits, 
loss of lunch period for the duty teachers and many 
others too numerous to mention. 

Under the second of our present day approaches 
the children are allowed a short eating period, usu¬ 
ally 20 to 2^ minutes, and then return directly to 
the classroom for the continuation of their studies. 

Duty teachers supervise the eating period and are 
responsible for lunchroom behavior. Under the system 
there is no escape for either the teacher or the pupil. 
The lunch period is a necessary evil to be gotten over 
with as quickly as possible. With the teacher and 
pupils safely back in their rooms order and quiet can 
again reign supreme. The mental hygiene of both pupil 
and teacher is completely sublimated to a speed-up 
system that solves the problem by avoiding it. Neither 
of these approaches is able to fill the void, we must 
look for something new—perhaps a combination and modi¬ 
fication of the two systems already described. Our new 
systan must be equitable to teachers and educationally 
sound in terms of pupil needs in order to fill the void 
adequately.2 

Industry has long since recognized that production 
can be increased significantly by providing rest periods, 
adequate lunch time, and a shorter work day. The roaring 
machines can be turned off to provide the worker with peace 
and quiet. Principals and teachers are faced with a far more 
difficult problem: they must deal with children who will not 
permit themselves to be turned on or off at will. Thus the 
question is: ”Can we devise a lunch period situation that 
will adequately meet the needs of children and at the same

The Problem 

The purpose of this study was ^1) to ascertain the 
current practices in noon-hour supervision in Alberta schools 
in which part of the pupils are conveyed; (2^ to obtain re¬ 
actions of classroom teachers and parents to various problems 
of noon-hour supervision; and O) “to suggest how centralized 
schools might best handle the problem of noon-hour supervi¬ 
sion. Three sets of questionnaires were developed as instru¬ 
ments for collecting data# The main questionnaires which 
were sent to principals of schools were prepared first. The 
following questions received attention: 

1. What are the arrangements for supervising the school 
and the playgrounds? 

2# what are the arrangements for supervising the lunch¬ 
rooms? 

3. How are indoor activities organized and supervised? 

4* How are sports supervised? 

3. what are the arrangements for allowing conveyed stu¬ 
dents to go up-town at noon? 

6. .what equipment and accommodation are available? 

7. How is staff co-operation obtained for noon-hour 
supervision? 

8. what are the functions of noon-hour supervision?

is so great that they must use every hour available during

the school day to direct the development of the pupil." it 
is felt that a good noon-hour program can provide an excel¬ 
lent opportunity for social development. 

The trend towards centralization of schools in Alberta 
is relatively recent. I'he problems Inherent in noon-hour 
supervision are^ in some schools, just emerging, to the best 
of the writer^s knowledge, a study of this kind has never been 
undertaken in Alberta, it is hoped, therefore, that the find¬ 
ings and recommendations of this study will be of value to 
teachers, principals and administrators in developing noon- 
hour programs of high quality. 

^cope and limitations .--The population selected for 
the main questionnaire used in this study consisted of ninety 
principals of Alberta village and town schools in which twen¬ 
ty per cent or more of the pupils were conveyed and in which 
three or more high school teachers were engaged. In addition, 
120 questionnaires were sent to classroom teachers in selected 
centralized schools of seven school divisions of Alberta. 

Also, one hundred questionnaires were sent to selected parents 
of two centralized schools in the Smoky Lake School Division.

RBVlJli^ OJJ* THE RELATED Lli'ERATaRE 


This chapter presents a review of literature dealing 
with practices in noon-hour supervision in American central¬ 
ized schools. The information is organized under the fol¬ 
lowing headings2 supervision of lunch rooms and cafeterias; 
supervision of playgrounds; and organization and supervision 
of indoor activities. 

Supervision of Lunch Rooms and Cafeterias 
Gurtailing noon-hour period .—In some American 
schools the problem of supervising the noon-hour has been 
reduced by curtailing the noon period and allowing the stu¬ 
dents just enough time to eat lunch before returning to 
their studies. Gartrell favors this practice and gives the 
following as one reason: "The administration feels that 
vigorous physical activity by the students during the noon- 
hour, either before or after eating, is not in accord with 
recognized health principles."^ This contention is not sup¬ 
ported by other writers. Miller, Moyer and Patrick state: 

Criticism is sometimes offered that participation 
in active and highly competitive sports following the

Dilemma," Ohio Schools . 32:2o, January, 19^4.

noon meal is undesirable and harmful* uonversations 
with the directors of these successful programs have 
failed to substantiate this criticism. They report 
that if the participants for the day are supervised 
to see that good health rules of eating and diet are 
observed, the incidence of illness or other observable 
unfavorable reactions is no higher than at timeSpWhen 
pupils do not participate in these active games. 

Another article supports the same view: "Scientific 
tests show that not only is the afternoon performance improved 
by the elongated lunch hour, but that the teacher herself is 

3 

less fatigued at the end of the day." 

Staggered lunch periods .—«lhere the cafeteria faci¬ 
lities are inadequate to seat the entire student body at one 
time, staggered lunch periods are scheduled in some schools. 

under this plan several classes are sent into the lunchroom at 

4 

designated intervals. Brackett has found that this arrange¬ 
ment reduced hall congestion and minimized organizational 

detail. There is considerable consensus, in the literature, 

5 6 

on the staggered lunch plan. Hatfield and i.owe, Hancarrow,

tiealth and nutrition education. --One study recom¬ 
mends that instruction be given in healthful eating habits 
such as washing hands before lunch, using a napkin, eating 
slowly and eating dessert last; and that a nutrition program 

be established to seek parental co-operation to make the "bag 

g 

lunch" a balanced lunch. Norris takes a similar view; he 
advocates that teaching desirable food selection and correct 
eating habits should be one of the principal goals of the 
school lunch program, bheppard^^ states that in his school 
menus are planned with the pupils and sent home in advance. 
This enables the mothers to plan the evening meal so that the 
food the child had at noon will not be duplicated at home on 
the same day. In another elementary school^^ the lunch hour 
is considered an integral part of the school program: the 
children are taught nutritional values, weights and measure¬ 
ments, handling of money, and courtesy. The writer believes

that these practices appear quite feasible and, undoubtedly, 
desirable in Alberta centralized schools, particularly in 
elementary grades. 

Parent supervision .—There is definite support in the 
12 

literature that teachers should have relief from noon-hour 
duties while they are having lunch themselves. Novel prac¬ 
tices which provide this relief are described in two articles. 

13 

in some one-room schools parents take turns in providing 

14 

soup. In another school fifty mothers volunteered to help 
with the preparation of the lunch and its supervision. 

supervision of the Playground 
According to the literature supervision of the play¬ 
grounds involves dividing the playground into areas for des¬ 
ignated activities, drawing up schedules for the activities, 
planning activities with pupils and teachers, selecting pupil 
leaders, and providing teacher or parent supervision for the 
activities. 

13 

Areas for organized play .—Trethaway states that

inherent in playground supervision is a plan showing the loca¬ 
tion of the play areas, diamonds, courts, apparatus, and mar¬ 
ginal areas for both primary and upper grade children. He has 
a valid reason for his contention: usually the older, more ag¬ 
gressive pupils usurp the larger and better areas for their 
team or large group games while the smaller children and 
those inclined toward individual and small group play are 

pushed off to marginal areas. The same view is expressed by 
16 17 

Kilroy, McCooe and Hutchinson, and the Committee on 

l8 

Problems of the Lunch Hour. 

19 

bcheduled activities .—Trethaway maintains that 

each teacher should be provided with a schedule of the play 

areas and a mimeographed sketch showing the location of these 

areas on the playground. The committee on Problems of the 
20 

Lunch Hour states that where there is not enough equipment, 
such as swings and slides, to accommodate all the children 
who are interested in using it, scheduling becomes necessary. 
The purpose of scheduling is to insure participation by most,

if not all, pupils. Norris says: "Students should be gently 
guided into activities. This can probably be accomplished 
best by the use of student committees that can plan methods 
for inducing the more reticent boys and girls to participate 

21 

in the varied activities. The program should be voluntary.'* 

Pupil participation in activity planning .—A planned 
program should take into consideration the interests of the 
different age groups within the school. Pupil selection of 
types of activities provides a good basis upon which to build 
the entire program. Axtell and Kobinson state: 

The noon-hour program for each semester should be 
democratically planned by the administrator, the staff 
and the pupils# It is dangerous to assume that the 
plans made for one semester will meet the wishes of the 
pupils for all time. Also, there is a decided advantage 
in the policy of participation. Pupils should feel that 
they have a chance to determine their own activities and 
the right to change what is unpleasant to them.^^ 

23 

Watrous supports this view and suggests that a pupil commit¬ 
tee under a teacher sponsor can be used effectively to plan 
noon-hour activities. 

Pupil leaders .—There is considerable consensus that 
pupil leaders can assist teachers in supervising the playground

activities. Mcuooe and Hutchinson, Trethaway, and 
Hilroy^^ have found this practice effective, ihe duties for 
which pupil leaders are held responsible include: ^1^ check¬ 
ing out and returning equipment and supplies, ^2; organizing 
and instructing the participants in the activity, seeing 
that rules of safety and fair play are followed at each game, 

and keeping order at the activity. However, iixtell and 
27 

Hobinson caution teachers not to give one child authority 
over another, xhat must remain a teacher responsibility. 

Teacher or parent supervision .--Axtell and Hobinson*^ 
say that all teachers should be available for assignment 
as noon-hour supervisors. However, they recommend that to 
maintain peak teaching efficiency, the principal should sched¬ 
ule classes so that each teacher receives a free period to 

29 

compensate for the extra time spent on noon-duty, nalish ^ 
is in accord with the last statement. But if one mother*s 
innovation could be duplicated in schools, then no com¬ 
pensation would be necessary. On her own initiative, Mrs.

Vanderbilt organized a group of mothers to take turns in 

supervising pupil activities in the elementary school that 

her child attends. Credence is given to this practice by the 

51 

Committee on Problems of the Lunch hour which in its visits 
to various schools found parents rendering cafeteria and 
lunchroom duties, administering first aid, playing games with 
the children and, in general, assisting teachers with noon- 
hour supervision. 

Organization and supervision of indoor Activities 

The keynote to the organization of noon-hour indoor 
activities is pupil-staff participation in planning and 

scheduling activities. This approach is strongly recommended 

32 33 3^ 5 *5 

by Anderson, Gribble, iialish, and hatfield and Lowe.-^*^ 

Axtell and Robinson say: »*If the children are encouraged to 

participate in planning of the noon-hour activities, they 

36 

will feel that they are doing what they want to do.”

Gribble and Norris state that indoor activities 
should be supervised by the teachers. Both writers suggest 
a long list of activities suitable for indoors. Tilton 
recommends a noon-movie program as a main indoor activity, 
especially during inclement weather, he offers the follow¬ 
ing justification: 

The noon-movie program is becoming a definite part 
of the secondary curriculum because it diminishes noon- 
hour discipline, excess hall congestions by providing 
a desirable place for students to go, keeps students in 
the school building instead of in the streets, provides 
a form of recreation which the students request, and 
creates a source of income which can be used to finance 
the audio-visual program. The majority of schools 
having such a program report favorable reactions from 
students, teachers, administrators, and parents.‘*39

METHOD OE PROCEDURE 

Most of the related literature reviewed in the last 
chapter was carefully studied before the first draft of the 
main questionnaire, used in this study, was prepared. Most 
of the periodicals which contained the articles on noon-hour 
supervision were not available from the Libraries of the Uni¬ 
versity of Alberta. Therefore, these were obtained from the 
publishers. In preparing the first draft of the question¬ 
naire the suggestions given by uood and bcates^ were used as 

2 

far as possible, in addition two theses were read to ob¬ 
tain suggestions in framing questions. The first draft was 
criticized by the thesis committee and then by ten princi¬ 
pals. (A copy of the letter sent to the principals appears 
in Appendix A.) After the second draft was criticized by 
the thesis committee, the final draft was prepared. On May 
7 , 19^7, the questionnaires were mailed to ninety principals

of Alberta centralized schools in which three or more high 
school teachers were engaged and in which twenty per cent or 
more of the pupils wore conveyed. (A sample of the question¬ 
naire and accompanying letter are included in Appendix A.^ 

The questionnaires which were mailed to principals 
sought data for two separate M. Ad. theses, the writer’s and 
Mr. ateve Boyko*s. aince Mr. Boyko used the same popula¬ 
tion as the writer, it was suggested by the thesis committee 
that one questionnaire be prepared for both studies. The 
reason given was that the potential respondents would more 
likely complete one longer questionnaire than two shorter 
ones. The writer, therefore, worked with Mr. Boyko in pre¬ 
paring the second and third drafts of the questionnaire. 
Appendix A, however, shows only that portion of the question¬ 
naire prepared by the writer and used in this study. 

A populative survey was undertaken in this study. The 
schools that conveyed more than twenty per cent of the pupils 
were determined from the ’’Operation Keport 19^6-19^7 1 ” com¬ 
piled by the Department of education. The mailing addresses 
of the principals of the schools chosen were obtained from 
a booklet entitled ’’Accredited Secondary schools in Alberta 
19^6-19^7,” prepared by the Department of Aducation. All

"Current Practices in Axtracurricular Activities in Alberta 
Centralized schools.”

but two schools met the definition used for the population, 
iiowever, these two schools were included in the tabulations 
of Chapter iv. 

On June 4, 19^1, a follow-up letter*^ was sent to 
twenty-four principals who by that date had not returned the 
questionnaires. Jiighteen more questionnaires were returned 
making a total of eighty-four, or 9J>»^ per cent. 

Originally it was planned to send questionnaires 
only to principals. However, at the first thesis comoiittee 
it was suggested to send questionnaires also to classroom 
teachers and to parents. Accordingly the two sets of ques¬ 
tionnaires were prepared, sent out to teachers and parents 
for criticism and then redrafted. I'hese questionnaires were 
then criticized by the thesis committee which stated that 
the final draft could be prepared without revision of the 
second draft. 

The teacher questionnaires^ were sent to ten princi¬ 
pals, personally known to the writer, of centralized schools 
in seven different school divisions in the northern part of 
the province. These principals were asked to distribute 
the questionnaires to their staffs, then to collect and re¬ 
turn them. (The accompanying letter appears in Appendix B.) 
All the principals returned the questionnaires as requested:

The parent questionnaires were distributed in two 
centralized schools of the timoky Lake School Division. Fifty 
questionnaires were distributed by the writer in the Vilna 
district and fifty by Mr. Michael Skuba, principal of D. A. 
Kostash School, in the Smoky Lake district* Approximately 
twice as many questionnaires were distributed to parents 
whose children were conveyed as to parents whose children 
resided in town* (In both these districts about two-thirds 
of the pupils are conveyed.) A total of ninety-four parent 
questionnaires were completed and returned. 

The data received from principals, teachers, and 
parents were compiled and tabulated in chapters four, five, 
and six of this thesis.

received to item three, thirty-three schools do not supervise 
all classrooms. Of these, twenty-two stated that their class 
rooms are locked: twenty-one stated that this was a staff 
policy and one said that it was a board regulation. 

This item required editing. If a principal checked 
the preceding item, 2(,a), then his answer to question three 
was not accepted. Several answers, therefore, were not 
counted. 

Table VII gives a summary of the answers received to 
item four of the questionnaire, in seventy-one schools super 
vision is carried out by all members of the staff. Three 
schools obtain assistance from pupils and three from janitors 
In one school there is no supervision at all. 

in completing item five of the questionnaire, 
seventy-eight principals indicated that they schedule the 
supervision in their schools. Table VIll gives a summary of 
the arrangements used. In forty-six schools teachers take 
turns in supervision on a daily basis, whereas in twenty- 
seven schools this is done on a weekly basis. In three 
schools scheduling is not really necessary as the same 
teachers supervise every day. Two other schools have not 
specified how their supervision is scheduled. 

The remaining six of the eighty-four schools do not 
schedule supervision, in three of these the janitors super¬ 
vise, in one the principal supervises, in one the same two 
staff members supervise, and in one there is no supervision.

only six schools use this in some or all grades. The least 
promising arrangement, in the writer’s opinion, is requiring 
all pupils to obtain permission from the principal; this is 
the practice in three schools.

thirty«sev 0 n have found effective checks against the abuses 
of that privilege. Devising checks is difficult indeed, as 
is supported by the fact that twenty-five principals have 
not found any. Of the thirty-seven schools which have de¬ 
vised checks, twenty-seven either limit the pupils* visits 
up-town or have supervisors take occasional **walks.” Other 
checks include cancelling privileges, talking to merchants, 
and obtaining reports from the town constable.

item 7 of the questionnaire, xwo principals left out this 

item; eighteen mariced it partially, when all the ranKs for 

2 

each function were taken into account, the functions of 
noon-hour supervision, as seen by the principals, in descen¬ 
ding order of importance are: 

1. To preserve order and discipline 

2. To protect pupils from accidents 

3. To guide pupils into worthwhile activities 

4 . To protect school property 
To develop pupils socially 

6. To provide protection against legal liability 
7# TO be on call to settle difficulties. 

The sixth and seventh functions as listed above are, 

in the writer’s opinion, least important. But, according to 

5 4 

Norris^ and Axtell and tiobinson, functions three and five 
should head the list. 

uther functions of noon-hour supervision suggested by 
three principals are: to become really acquainted and friendly 
with pupils; to maintain good school morale; to meet parents 
who may drop in at noon.

supervised by teachers. Others are supervised by responsi¬ 
ble students, janitor and principal. It is significant to 
note that no schools obtain assistance in lunch room super¬ 
vision from parents.

stated that they provide hot lunches. Of these three stated 
that they provide the hot lunch to all grades; one to grades 





















1-9; two to grades 1-6; one to primary grades only. The hot 
lunches consist of either soup or cocoa: five schools indica¬ 
ted that they provide both. In three schools the cost of 
materials is met by pupils; in three by the board and pupils; 
in one by the board. 

‘fable XIY summarizes the replies to item six of the 
questionnaire. JJifty-four schools stated that they desig¬ 
nate the length of time that the children must eat lunch. 
iJorty-nine of these allow fifteen or twenty minutes for 
eating lunch, four allow thirty minutes and one allows only 
ten minutes.

pupils to bring a balanced lunch to school. In sixty schools 
this is done by teachers in home room classes. In twenty 
schools this encouragement is given by the Home Economics 
teacher or lunch supervisor or District Health nurse. In 
seven schools balanced lunches are discussed at Home and 
School meetings.

ments. The table indicates that in sixteen schools all the 
pupils who eat lunch in school help to clean the lunch rooms. 
This is not the best arrangement, in the writer's opinion, 
as it is not very specific. The other arrangements listed 
are superior because designated individuals or grades are 
held responsible for the cleaning to be done.

*This table includes only those schools whose noon-hour 
is of the same length in summer and in winter. 


The table shows that forty-eight schools have a noon-hour 
only one hour long. This is, according to one article,^ too 
short a period for providing an ambitious program of noon- 
hour activities. The other twenty-four schools provide be¬ 
tween seventy and ninety minutes for the noon intermission. 

Twelve of the eighty-four schools, not included in 
Table XIX, provide longer noon-hours in summer than in winter. 
Of these, six have a noon-hour of one and a half hours in sum¬ 
mer and one hour in winter; five have a noon-hour of one and a 
quarter hours in summer and one hour in winter; one has a noon- 
hour of one and a half hours in summer and one and a quarter 
hours in winter.

they plan noon-hour activities with their pupils; fifteen 
stated that they don’t plan. The methods used to plan with 
different grades are summarized in Table JOC, The table shows 
that forty-two schools plan noon-hour activities with the 
high school pupils at the students* Union meetings, and four¬ 
teen do so at general assembly meetings, it is the writer’s 
experience that in large groups of pupils relatively few in¬ 
dividuals are likely to participate in discussions. Thirty- 
seven schools plan noon-hour activities with the elementary

pupils in individual classes. The table indicates that this 
approach is practiced also in the primary, Junior high and 
senior high school grades. ii;ight schools plan activities by 
teacher-sponsored aport Committees or clubs. This approach 

n 8 

is recommended by Axtell and Robinson,' and uvatrous. Other 
methods used for planning activities include discussions in 
correlation with enterprise work and discussions prompted by 
appropriate films. 

Item three of this section of the questionnaire is 
summarized in Tables aXL to XXIli inclusive. Table XXI shows 
the number of schools providing various indoor activities as 
well as the number of schools employing schedules for these 
Indoor activities. The ten most popular indoor activities 
are ping pong, volley ball, basketball, checkers, square 
dancing, Chinese checkers, snakes and ladders, ring toss, 
badminton, and noon films. The table shows that a high per¬ 
centage of the schools schedule their activities. 

The sums obtained by adding the numbers horizontally 
for each activity shown in Table XXII do not necessarily 
agree with the corresponding number of schools as indicated 
in Table XXI, because many principals indicated that the 
supervision was carried out by the staff and students, iiiight

popular activities in gymnasiuois are basketball, volley ball 
and badminton. Others include ping pong, tumbling, dancing 
and noon films* it is significant to note that 77*4 per cent 
of the larger centralized schools of Alberta have gymnasiums. 

In answer to item five, fifty-seven principals 
stated that they encourage the withdrawing type of student 
to participate in at least one activity during the noon-hour. 
Table jCQT summarizes the methods used. The writer feels that 
individual counselling and House League games hold most pro¬ 
mise in obtaining participation from a withdrawing type of 
student.

and collect games and equipment. The literature supports 
this practice, bixty-one schools have various staff members 
responsible for this duty. The practice in which only the 
principal or the Janitor issues and collects games and equip¬ 
ment appears questionable, in the writer's opinion.

they don*t do so. The writer feels that the program offered 
by a school should be reviewed periodically in order that any 
shortcomings may be corrected. Of the fifty-seven principals 
mentioned above, forty-two stated that when changes are made 
in the activity program, the students are consulted first; 
fifteen stated that they don't consult pupils. Axtell and 
Kobinson would not agree with the action of these fifteen 
principals. They state: "Pupils should feel that they have 
a chance to determine their own activities and the right to 
change what is unpleasant to them. 

Outdoor bport Activities 

In this study sport activities are examined only from 
the point of view of whether they are coached by teachers or 
not. There is another study^^ under way which will treat this 
topic more fully. The data received to this item of the ques¬ 
tionnaire is summarized in Table XXVII. 

The table shows that softball is coached by teachers 
in most schools. Curling and hardball are coached by teach¬ 
ers in forty-eight and forty-three schools respectively. 

Hockey is coached by teachers in thirty-five schools and touch 
rugby in thirty-three schools, boccer and broomball are 
coached by teachers in relatively few schools.

The table shows that most schools have a movie projector and 
filmstrip projector. These make noon shows possible noon- 
hour activities. Most schools have record players and radios 
while approximately half have tape recorders and i"* A. tJystems 
which make music listening and dancing possible noon-hour 
activities, seventeen schools can boast about inter-room 
communication systems. The writer believes that these are a 
great asset for noon-hour supervision in the larger schools. 







CHAPTER V 


THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS’ VIEWS OE SUPERVISION 

This chapter presents the data and opinions received 
through the medium of questionnaires from 112 classroom tea¬ 
chers of centralized schools. The information is classified, 
in most cases, on the basis of thirty primary, twenty-eight 
elementary, twenty-eight junior high school and twenty-six 
senior high school teachers. 

In answer to the first part of item one of the ques¬ 
tionnaire, all the teachers stated that they have noon-hour 
supervision in their schools. However, four teachers stated 
that they were not required to act as supervisors: one elemen¬ 
tary teacher; two junior high school teachers; and one senior 
high school teacher. The duties for which teachers are res¬ 
ponsible are given in Table AXIX. The table reveals that, in 
general, all teachers are responsible for the same duties re¬ 
gardless of the grades taught, except in the case of coaching 
sports. These duties include supervising lunch rooms, home¬ 
room classrooms, all classrooms on one floor, one or more 
buildings, one or more playgrounds; acting as school librarian 
or custodian of games and equipment; being on call to settle 
difficulties if and when they arise. In most schools sports 
are coached by junior high and senior high school teachers.

The table shows that only one elementary teacher supervises 
hockey and three supervise softball; and that primary teach¬ 
ers don*t supervise sports at all.

Item two of the questionnaire is summarized in Table 
XXX. The table shows that the noon duties are approximately 
equally distributed to all teachers, regardless of the grades 
taught. A total of seventy-eight teachers supervise for one 
hour and a half or less on a per week basis, uf these, 
thirty-six teachers are on noon-duty for one hour and twenty- 
four teachers for one hour and a half. Thirty teachers are 
on duty for two hours or more, iileven of these supervise for

five hours each week, it appears that most of these thirty- 


teachers commute. 

Item three was included in the questionnaire to de- 
teimine whether classroom teachers would rank the listed func¬ 
tions of noon-hour supervision differently than principals. 

A summary of this item is given in Table XXXI.

When all the ranks for each function were taken into 
account, the functions of noon-hour supervision as seen by 
classroom teachers, in descending order of importance, are 
the same as those given by the principals on page 31. Sixteen 
teachers marked this item partially. Two elementary teachers 
























^4 

suggested that another function of noon-hour supervision is 
to give pupils a sense of security; one junior high school 
teacher suggested that another function is to administer 
first aid. 

In answer to the first part of item four, eighty-one 
teachers stated that their principals hold some staff meet¬ 
ings during which the noon-hour activities are planned and 
the duties are assigned; thirty-one stated that their prin¬ 
cipals don’t do so. This information is very consistent with 
that given by principals on page 46. The teachers' reactions 
to these staff meetings are summarized in Table XXXII. The 
table shows that seventy-eight teachers considered their meet¬ 
ings either highly democratic or moderately democratic. Only 
three teachers felt that these meetings were undemocratic.

much of teachers. Thirty-two teachers complained that duties 
are not clearly defined, and twenty-eight complained that 
noon-duties are not equally assigned to all teachers. Three 
teachers complained that the principals are too autocratic. 
Twenty teachers stated that they had no complaints at all. 

Other complaints, not included in the table, given by 
teachers were: there are too many buildings to supervise; 
some teachers shirk responsibility; it is unfair to have only 
those teachers supervise who commute. 

The final item of this questionnaire is summarized in 
Table JUjCiV. The table shows that only eight teachers feel 
that their noon-hour program gives their pupils something 
worthwhile to do. This is disconcerting. This situation 
may, perhaps, be partly ascribed to the fact that the equip¬ 
ment is inadequate as expressed by ninety teachers, iiighty 
teachers stated that they are consulted first when changes 
are contemplated in the supervisory program which stands to 
affect them, jjiighty-two teachers feel that noon-hour activi¬ 
ties should be scheduled; seventy-three, that the time they 
are required to spend on noon-duty is reasonable; sixty-three, 
that their staffs accept noon-duties willingly. About one 
half of the teachers feel the noon-duty involves hardships or 
sacrifices on their part; about one third feel that pupils who 
participate in noon-hour activities do better in school.work. 
There is definite agreement that conveyed pupils should obtain 
permission to go up-town. Only twenty-five teachers believe

THJL PAREm'i?* VIEWS OE SUPERVISION 

This chapter presents the data and opinions as recor¬ 
ded on questionnaires received from ninety-four parents* The 
information was classified, in most cases, on the basis of 
sixty parents whose children are conveyed to school and thirty- 
four parents whose children reside in town. 

Table XXXV gives a summary of the parents who filled 
out the questionnaires. The table shows that fifty-four ques¬ 
tionnaires were completed by both parents working together. 
Twenty questionnaires were completed by mothers; and twenty, 
by fathers.

■ In answer to the first part of item one of the ques¬ 
tionnaire, eighty-five parents stated that it is the teachers' 


























duty to supervise the school and playgrounds and nine stated 


that it isn’t. Table XXXVI gives a su ram ary of the answers 
to the second part of this item. The table indicates that 
parents whose children are conveyed and parents whose chil¬ 
dren reside in town hold almost the same views regarding 
what places should be supervised. These, in order of fre¬ 
quency, are: playgrounds; classrooms; gymnasium; play-rooms; 
hallways; lunch rooms; and business places up-town, with 
respect to business places two parents specified that teach¬ 
ers should supervise the town cafe.

whose children are conveyed, about four times as many sup¬ 
port the provision for hot lunch as those who oppose it. in 
the case of parents whose children reside in town, there are 
approximately the same number of parents for hot lunch as 
against. The two hot lunches suggested by most parents are 
cocoa and soup. Torty-three parents whose children are con¬ 
veyed indicate that they are willing to pay for xihe hot lunch;

six are not willing to do so. Eleven parents whose children 
reside in town would be willing to pay for a hot lunch; five 
would not. fourteen of sixty parents whose children are con¬ 
veyed indicated that their children eat lunch up-town. Of 
these, thirteen would rather have them eat a hot lunch in 
school. The next item is quite revealing: twenty-six parents 
would be willing to take turns to prepare hot lunches in 
school. JMineteen of these indicate that they could come out 
once a month; five, once every two weeks; and two, once every 
week. The last item is quite disappointing: only two parents 
would be willing to take turns, once a month, to supervise 
the play activities of elementary pupils, during the noon-hour. 

aome comments regarding hot lunches included: high 
school girls should take turns in preparing hot lunches; a 
cook should be hired to prepare the noon lunch; a school 
cafeteria should be provided. 

Some comments regarding supervision of play activities 
includedJ parents are not experienced in supervision; it is 
hard for out-of-town people to come in to supervise; teachers, 
not parents, should supervise play activities; a supervisor 
should be hired to look after noon-hour activities. 

In answer to the first part of item three of the 
questionnaire, fifty-three parents whose children are con¬ 
veyed stated that pupils should obtain permission to go up¬ 
town; seven stated that such permission is not necessary. 
Twenty-eight parents whose children reside in town stated

that conveyed pupils should obtain pemission to go up-town; 
six stated that such permission is not necessary. The ar¬ 
rangements suggested for obtaining permission appear in Table 
XTO’III. The table shows that the three most popular arrange¬ 
ments suggested by parents whose pupils are conveyed are the 
ones actually practiced in fifty-two schools, in the same 
order of preference. (See Table IX). These parents, how¬ 
ever, suggest that more passes should be used than indicated

by actual practice in Table IX. The suggestion that only 
the oldest child in each family obtain permission from the 
supervisor appears promising, in the opinion of the writer. 

Uf the parents whose children reside in town, sixteen sug¬ 
gest that pupils obtain permission from the supervisor; 
twelve, that all pupils obtain written permission from 
parents; eight, that pupils be allowed one to three passes 
per week; and four, that only the oldest pupil in the family 
obtain permission from the supervisor in charge. 

The last item of the questionnaire is summarized in 
Table XXXIX. The table reveals that eighty-one parents be¬ 
lieve that all pupils should be encouraged to participate in 
noon-hour activities. The answers to the next two items in¬ 
dicate quite positively that parents are opposed to extra 
pay for noon-hour supervision or the other form of compensa¬ 
tion suggested, it is encouraging to note, however, that 
forty-three parents believe that the teachers should have 
their lunch period free of supervising pupils. This prac¬ 
tice is advocated in the literature.^ Torty-one parents 
state that they are not kept informed of the noon-hour 
program carried on in their school. Tifty-eight parents 
would be willing to have the school board spend more money 
on games and equipment for noon-hour activities; fifty-seven

they should help to correct unfounded criticism of their

school’s noon-activity program. Over seventy per cent of 
the parents believe that the children who participate in 
noon-hour activities do better in school. Table XXXLY indi¬ 
cates that only about thirty per cent of the teachers hold 
the same view, uifty-five parents are opposed to have the 
school board hire special supervisors to look after noon- 
hour supervision. 

Some comments following this item were: teachers 
interested in good noon-hour supervision should be retained 
on the staff; special Physical Mucation teachers should be 
hired to coach all sports and game activities; teachers who 
coach sports after four o’clock should be paid for doing so.

Practices Revealed by Principals 
The questionnaires sent to principals were designed 
to determine, through a populative survey, the current prac 
tices in noon-hour supervision. On the basis of per 

cent returns, most centralized schools in Alberta have a 
working arrangement for noon-hour supervision, conceived 
democratically without pressure from outside authorities. 
The classrooms and playgrounds are supervised in the major! 
ty of schools by all members of the staff who take turns 
according to prepared schedules. Most principals require 
conveyed pupils to obtain permission if they want to go up¬ 
town at noon, and some principals have devised checks to 
prevent abuses of this privilege. 

Most principals assign classrooms for lunchrooms, 
supervised by the staff, where the pupils are required to 
eat for a designated interval of time. However, about one- 
fifth of the schools allow the pupils to eat wherever they 
wish, unsupervised. Hot lunches, either cocoa or soup, are 
provided in very few schools indeed, but the majority of 
schools encourage their pupils to bring balanced lunches. 
The majority of schools enforce tidiness, particularly in 






67 


Junior grades, during the lunch period, and approximately 
half the schools have an arrangement for cleaning up lunch 
rooms. 

More than half of the schools have a noon-intermis¬ 
sion only one hour long. Most schools plan noon-hour acti¬ 
vities with their pupils; half the schools use the otudents* 
union meetings for this purpose. Almost naif the schools 
have teachers plan the activities with individual classes, in 
the Junior grades. Most schools provide a large and varied 
number of indoor activities suitable for the various age 
levels of the pupils. A considerable number of these acti¬ 
vities are scheduled; however, no schools have staff super¬ 
vision for all the activities undertaicen. in this respect, 
most sport activities are regularly coached by Junior and 
high school teachers, bixty-five schools nave gymnasiums 
and, therefore, adequate accommodation for varied noon-hour 
indoor activities. Moreover, most schools have sucn equip¬ 
ment as movie projectors, tape recorders, radios and P. A. 
systems which may be used for noon shows, music listening 
and school dancing. 

TO reduce teachers’ supervisory duties, the majority 
of schools have responsible students issue and collect games 
and equipment used for noon-activities. Most principals en¬ 
courage the withdrawing type of student to participate in at 
least one activity during the noon-hour, and most devote 
several staff meetings to an evaluation of the noon-hour

program. One half of the schools consult with the pupils 
first when changes in the noon-hour program are contemplated. 

Views Held bv Teachers 

The questionnaires sent to teachers sought to obtain 
their views on some problems inherent in noon-hour supervi¬ 
sion. un the basis of 112 questionnaires, the teachers feel 
that the functions of noon-hour supervision, in descending 
order of importance, are; 

1. To preserve order and discipline 

2. ‘To protect pupils from accidents 

To guide pupils into worthwhile activities 

4. ‘To protect school property 

To develop pupils socially 

6. ‘i’o provide protection against legal liability 

7. To be on call to settle difficulties. 

It is, perhaps, significant to note that the principals ranked 
the above functions in the same order. 

Almost all the teachers feel that the staff meetings 
at which noon-hour activities are planned and duties assigned 
are either highly or moderately democratic. Most of the teach¬ 
ers are consulted first when changes are made in the supervi¬ 
sory program which stand to affect them. The majority of 
teachers believe that noon-hour duties are accepted willingly 
by the staff. 

Most teachers feel that noon-hour activities should 
be scheduled. Kowever, most teachers feel that the present 











6 ? 


facilities and equipment in the schools are inadequate and 
that few pupils have worthwhile things to do. Only about 
one-third of the teachers believe that the pupils who parti¬ 
cipate in noon-hour activities do better in their school 
work, i'he teachers are almost unanimous in their belief 
that the pupils should obtain permission if they want to go 
up-town. 

beventy-three teachers believe that the time they are 
required to spend on noon-duty is reasonable; yet, fifty-four 
feel that noon-duties present sacrifices and hardships on 
their part. Only twenty-five teachers believe that their 
duties could be relieved partly by parent assistance. 

Twenty teachers have no complaints at all about noon- 
hour supervision as practiced in their schools. Others com¬ 
plain that there is no remuneration; that it is unfair to 
give up time needed for one's cwn lunch, that the public de¬ 
mands too much of teachers; that the duties are not clearly 
defined; and that some members of the staff have less than 
their fair share of noon-duties. 

Views Held bv Parents 

The questionnaires sent to parents were designed to 
obtain their reactions to some problems involved in noon-hour 
supervision. On the basis of ninety-four questionnaires, most 
parents believe that it is the teachers* duty to supervise the 
school and playgrounds. However, almost half the parents feel 
that the teachers should have their own lunch period free of

supervising pupils. The majority of parents would like the 
school to provide a hot lunch, and about one-third of these 
parents would be willing to take turns, once a month, to pre¬ 
pare cocoa, soup or stew. However, as far as supervising 
play activities of elementary pupils is concerned, only two 
parents would be willing to do so, once a month. 

Most parents agree that conveyed pupils should be 
required to obtain permission if they want to go up-town. 

Most parents also believe that all pupils should be encou¬ 
raged to participate in noon-hour activities and that such 
participants do better in their school work. The majority 
of parents would support the school board’s spending more 
money on games and equipment, and almost half are prepared 
to help correct unfounded criticism of their school’s noon- 
activity program. 

On matters of special interest to teachers, the 
parents are not very encouraging. Relatively few parents 
believe that teachers should be paid extra for noon-hour 
supervision, and very few believe that high school teachers 
who coach sports should be compensated by teaching fewer 
credits, irinally, only nine parents would agree to have the 
school board hire special noon-hour supervisors.

CONGLUblONi:) AND RECOMMENDATIONb 

Coneluslons 

‘i‘he conclusions listed below are based on the find¬ 
ings from the questionnaires received from principals, 
teachers and parents. The questionnaires received from 
teachers and parents were not the result of adequate samp¬ 
ling. Therefore, the conclusions based on these question¬ 
naires cannot be regarded as very conclusive. 

1. Noon-hour supervision has been accepted by almost 
all Alberta centralized schools as a necessary duty. 
Apparently only twelve schools^ have taken cognizance 
of the Departmental regulation which states ”In a 
school having more than one teacher the board shall 
be responsible for arranging with the principal and 
staff for such supervision of pupils as may be con¬ 
sidered necessary, upon such terms as may be agree- 

2 

able to both parties." 

2* Most principals practice good human relations with 
their staffs. This is supported by the finding that

in most schools noon-hour supervisory duties are 
planned with the staff and assigned democratically. 
This accounts for the finding that the majority of 
teachers accept noon-hour duties willingly. "Teach¬ 
ers will accept the responsibility of a new lunch 

program if they have a part in its development and 

3 

direction." 

jj. Principals and staffs are themselves responsible for 
the following two quite common complaints about noon- 
hour supervision: the duties are not clearly defined, 
and some staff members have less than their fair 
share of noon-duty. The findings reveal that some 
teachers spend up to five hours per week on noon- 
duty. This suggests that some teachers are required 
to supervise more than others. 8taff co-operation 
can hardly be expected under such circumstances. 

4. Most centralized schools of Alberta have gymnasiums, 
buch schools, in the writer's opinion, not only offer 
a wider range of indoor noon-hour activities than 
those that have no gymnasiums, but also find super¬ 
vision easier. Most schools also have adequate 
equipment for at least three worthwhile activities: 
noon shows, dancing and music listening. But the 
facilities for preparing hot lunches appear to be

practically non-existent. Worris^ advocates that, 
among others, two aims of the noon program are to 
furnish the pupils with an adequate meal and to pro¬ 
vide a health-teaching situation. The writer feels 
that these objectives of the noon program are not 
realized in most Alberta schools. This matter de¬ 
serves further study. 

Parent education is necessary in order that parents 
accept the contention that teachers should be remu¬ 
nerated, or compensated otherwise, for the time spent 
on noon-hour supervisory duties. This should not be 
too difficult for the findings reveal that almost half 
of the parents surveyed believe that teachers should 
have their own lunch free from responsibility of pu¬ 
pils. Moreover, most parents believe that their 
children do better in school if they participate in 
noon-hour activities; and most are in favor of spen¬ 
ding more money on games and equipment. 

6. A considerable number of schools do not schedule 

their activities. This is supported by the finding 
that the place most supervised in the schools is the 
hallways. One reason for not scheduling activities 
may be that it is time consuming. However, the 
writer suggests that there is another reason: the

noon-hour intemission is too short in most schools 
for any ambitious noon-hour program. 

7 . Teachers hold the same views as principals regarding 
the functions of noon-hour supervision, however, 
they believe that the emphasis should be on order 
and discipline rather than on social development 
which is advocated in the literature.-^ 

80 There is consensus among principals, teachers and 
parents that the pupils should obtain permission if 
they want to go up-town. The findings indicate that 
devising checks to prevent abuses of this privilege 
is a difficult problem. The practice of cancelling 
the privilege, if it is abused, appears effective: 
it is recommended by ibchroeder.^ 

9 . An interesting possibility exists in parents* will¬ 
ingness to take turns in preparing hot lunches in 
school. According to the literature"^ this is not 
novel in American schools. The findings of this 
study suggest that relatively few teachers have given 
serious consideration to this possible innovation.

10. I'he noon-hour programs in those schools which plan 
noon-hour activities with their pupils and hold 
evaluative staff meetings are superior to those 
found in schools where this is not done. l‘his view 

o 

is supported in the literature.° 

Recommendations 

Although some specific procedures are suggested in 
the recommendations listed below, this study does not pretend 
to give solutions for all the problems that may arise during 
the noon-hour. This cannot be done because each school has 
its own unique problems. However, the writer feels that 
these recommendations, which are supported by both the re¬ 
lated literature and the findings of this survey, unless 
otherwise specified, can be used as a starting point to de¬ 
velop a noon-hour program of high quality. It is, therefore, 
with the hope of stimulating serious thought and positive 
action that the following recommendations are made: 

!• The noon-hour proRraia should be planned early in the 

school year, every year^ by the staff and pupils . 

It is recognized that principals and staffs are ex¬ 
tremely busy at the beginning of the school year. 
However, the noon-hour program is as important as

organization of classes and administrative detail. 

The planned program should take into consideration 
the interests and abilities of the different age 
groups, it is suggested that a list of activities 
for the high school grades be prepared tentatively 
by committees composed of student representatives 
and staff advisers. This list should then be presen¬ 
ted to the iDtudents' union or general asseiably meet¬ 
ing for discussion, modification and acceptance. The 
writer recommends that planning in the primary and 
elementary grades be done in individual classes with 
home-room teachers. A good variety of games, such as 
checkers and ring toss, should be purchased for these 
children. 

2• Most of the activities, if not al l, should be sched ¬ 
uled . This is advocated in the literature but prac¬ 
tised only in some of the schools surveyed in this 
study, scheduled activities insure that all pupils 
will be given an opportunity to participate in at 
least one activity. This is extremely important in 
the case of an atypical child who, very often, is on 
his own during the noon-hour. All available space 
should be used, i^laygrounds should be divided into 
diamonds and courts, also play areas for the pupils 
in the primary and elementary grades; classrooms 
should be assigned to designated activities. Naturally 









77 

this will entail a great deal of work, nowever, the 
time and effort involved will be amply rewarded by 
lessening the strain of teacher supervision. 

!>. xhe noon-intermission should be not less than one and 
one~half hours long . This recomiriendation is supported 
in the literature but is not currently being followed 
in most Alberta schools. Authorities state that a 
good noon-hour program is as important, in its way, 
as classroom instruction, it appears, then, that the 
values to be realized from a well-organized noon-hour 
program warrant this third recommendation. 

4• All teachers should be available for supervision, in ¬ 

cluding the principal , iiiach teacher can make a con¬ 
tribution in guiding pupil development. The duties 
should be assigned fairly and scheduled as far apart 
as possible. Moreover, each teacher should be given 
an opportunity to eat his own lunch free from respon¬ 
sibility of pupils. The writer suggests that this 
may be done in junior grades by staggered dismissals 
for lunch, and in senior grades by providing "spares** 
before noon for teachers on those days when they are 
scheduled for noon-duty. 

b 0 Adequate steps should be taken to protect pupils from 

accidents and to protect school property . One possible 
approach, in the writer’s opinion, is to have indivi¬ 
dual classes with home-room teachers establish rules 















i 




78 


of safety and rules of conduct. 

6• Parents should be kept in f ormed of the noon-hour 

program . This can be done through such contacts as 
the Home and school meetings and the tJchool Paper. 
Parents’ co-operation should be solicited and their 
suggestions for improvement followed, as far as 
possible. 

7• Responsible st udents should be asked to assist teach ¬ 
ers with routine noon-hour duties , issuing and col¬ 
lecting gaiues and equipment can be done as well by 
pupils as teachers. This is not done in many schools 
but is recommended in the literature, buch practice 
not only relieves teachers from routine duties but 
also gives pupils valuable training in assuming res¬ 
ponsibilities. 

8• iiiating lunch should be c ons idered one of the most 
important noon-hour activities . Lunch rooms should 
be assigned and supervised by teachers; good rules 
of health and diet should be observed; and balanced 
lunches should be stressed. These practices are not 
presently being followed in most Alberta schools. 

The writer suggests that the possibility for hired 
help and parent assistance for preparing hot lunches 
, be explored thoroughly. 

9. The whole staff should participate in developing and 

stating the purposes of the noon-hour program .

iilmphasis should be placed on socialization among the 


pupils* This, according to the literature, is the 
keynote of noon-hour supervision. The program should 
be flexible enough to permit variations in the acti¬ 
vities; it should be evaluated periodically, iiuper- 
vision must facilitate pupil development; this is its 
primary justification.

Dear Principal: 

Your kind co-operation is respectfully solicited in 
completing the enclosed questionnaire which will serve as 
a basis for two separate m. theses. It was prepared 
under the guidance and approval of our thesis committee 
headed by ivir. H. T. oparby, Professor, faculty of Jiiduca- 
tion, University of Alberta. 

The centralization of schools in recent years has 
created some urgent problems in noon-hour supervision and 
extracurricular activities* we feel that you, as a prin¬ 
cipal of a centralized school, are in a position to offer 
valuable information on these problems. It is hoped that 
this information will lead to suggestions and recommenda¬ 
tions which will be of value to teachers, principals, and 
administrators. 

The questionnaire is essentially of a check-list type 
which will enable you to complete it with a minimum of 
time and effort. Please follow the directions as given in 
the body of the questionnaire. We will treat your answers 
with confidence. 

If at all possible, kindly complete and return the 
questionnaire in the enclosed stamped self-addressed 
envelope by May 23, 13^7* 

After compiling the data received from the question¬ 
naires, we will be glad to send you a summary. Please 
indicate whether this is your wish.

the questionnaire is essentially of a check-list type and can 
be completed quickly. 

Our theses can be completed adequately only if we obtain 
a high percentage of returns, lour co-operation will be

May 2^, 19^1 


My thesis committee has asked me to obtain reactions of 
classroom teachers to noon-hour supervision. 1 have decided 
to send “teacher" questionnaires to selected principals whom 
1 know personally in the hope that they will distribute these 
to their staffs, i trust that i can count on your co-operation 
and assistance. 

Jinclosed you will find thirteen questionnaires, twelve 
small envelopes and one large one. i would like you to dis¬ 
tribute one questionnaire and an envelope to one teacher of 
every grade in your school. The extra copy is for 

yourself which you don’t need to return, if you have more 
than one teacher in any grade, please decide yourself which 
one will complete the questionnaire for that grade. 

The questionnaire will take but a lew minutes to complete. 
TO ensure confidence, kindly ask each teacher to enclose the 
questionnaire in the small envelope provided, nindly collect 
these envelopes and return them to me in the large self- 
addressed, stamped envelops.
