ABSTRACT 


Radioactivity well logging, one of the 
newest processes for subsurface investigation, 
has proven to be of great value in correlation 
work and other stratigraphic studies. This thesis 
embodies work on three separate phases of the pro¬ 
cess. 

The high degree of radioactivity exhib¬ 
ited by the First White Speck zone, marking the 
top of the Colorado formation, has been invest¬ 
igated by means of Geiger Counter studies of 
powdered samples. No abnormally high radiations 
have been noted in the light, heavy, or bulk 
fractions of the samples, using apparatus avail¬ 
able in the Department of Physics. The counter, 
however, was not sufficiently shielded from cos¬ 
mic ray background to measure the low intensity 
of sedimentary radiation. Petrographic study of 
the samples shows three possible sources of radio¬ 
activity - bitumen, biotite and glauconite. 

The gamma ray log and electrical po¬ 
tential log are both found to exhibit some errors 
in determining formation contacts. It is the 
writer 1 s opinion that the gamma ray log is the 
more accurate of the two. A constant pattern 
of deviations in determining the tops of the 




horizons studied between the gamma ray log and 
electrical potential log is noted, and it is sugg 
ested that this pattern may be used in the deri¬ 
vation and application of corrections to the logs 
Gamma ray logs may be used in short and 
long range correlation work within and between 
oil fields. A high definition of strata exists 
in the logs and enables the observer to trace 
lithologic changes within a formation, if suff¬ 
icient numbers of logs are available. The logs 
may also be used as an aid in studying facies 
changes in the sedimentation of an area.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

The discovery of large petroleum res¬ 
ervoirs under the plains of central Alberta in 
1947 and 1948 tremendously stimulated the search 
for oil in this province. Large programs of ex¬ 
ploration have been undertaken by many oil com¬ 
panies, and the development of proven reserves 
has kept pace with the exploration. One of the 
results of this surge of activity has been the 
expansion and development of older methods of 
subsurface investigation, and a great influx of 
new methods. One of the most promising of the 
new tools of subsurface study is the radio¬ 
activity well log. 

Since its introduction in 1940 radio¬ 
activity well logging has been gaining steadily 
in popularity in the petroleum industry of the 
United States. The process was first used in 
Canada in August, 1949. Because of the newness 
of the process, geologists are not as well ac¬ 
quainted with it as with older methods. Great 
strides are being made in the study, however, 
and it is now used extensively in stratigraphic 
correlation work, and in porosity studies in 
such oil fields as Redwater.

Purpose of Thesis 

The purpose of this thesis is threefold: 

1. To study a phenomenon discovered when radio¬ 
activity surveys were first made in Alberta, which 
is the apparently large radioactive intensity 
manifest in the First White Speckled Shale zone 

of the Colorado formation. 

2. In a selected area, the Redwater Oil Field, 
to compare the relative accuracies of radio¬ 
activity logs and electric logs,(another form of 
well logging), in selecting formation contacts to 
a standard which is taken as being accurate. 

3. To show an application of the radioactivity 
log as a means of short range correlation within 
a single field, and as a means of long range co¬ 
rrelation between two fields. The value of the 
radioactivity log as a lithologic indicator is 
also discussed. 

Some mention is also made of another 
commercial application of the radioactivity log, 
the evaluation of reservoir rock porosity.

A STUDY OP THE RADIOACTIVITY OP THE FIRST WHITE 
SPECKLED SHALE ZONE OP THE COLORADO FORMATION 

I ntroduction 

In the past half century the radio¬ 
activity of rocks has been the subject of many 
investigations, the results of which have con¬ 
tributed much to the solution of geological pro¬ 
blems, Most of these studies, prior to 1940, have 
been on igneous rocks, and before 1933 the measure¬ 
ments were, as a rule, inaccurate due to lack of 
precision in standards (10,12).A Since 1933, when 
modern techniques and apparatus were developed for 
measuring the radioactivity of igneous rocks, many 
investigators have made laboratory analyses of 
these rocks. 

The advent of radioactivity well logging 
in 1939, a process which rapidly established itself 
as a standard means of oil field investigation, 
made apparent the need for sedimentary radio¬ 
activity studies. Russell (9,10,11), Evans and 
Goodman (2), Bell, Goodman and Whitehead (1), and 
others have pioneered this work, and their results 
have been used as the basis for present day work.

Radioactivlty of Sediments 

It has been found that all rocks con¬ 
tain measureable amounts of radioactive material, 
although it is generally present in extremely 
minute quantities. Most of the radioactive ele¬ 
ments belong to one of three series, the uranium, 
actino-uranium, or thorium series. Potassium is 
also radioactive, but it forms no series as its 
product undergoes no further change. 

A detailed discussion of the process of 
disintegration of radioactive material is beyond 
the scope of this thesis. The reader interested 
in this phase is referred to the literature at 
the end of part one (3,12,13,14). 

W.L, Russell has given us comprehensive 
information on sedimentary radioactivity. His 
analyses of the total gamma ray content of sed¬ 
iments by means of the Geiger Counter (10) has 
made possible the grouping of these sediments 
according to their relative radioactivities. This 
is shown in Table 1-1. 

The cause of sedimentary radioactivity 
has been explained chiefly by the presence of 
uranium-radium and thorium salts. Some authors 
favor the hypothesis that heavy minerals are re-

sponsible, but most say that the salts of these 
elements precipitate In conditions favoring the 
accumulation of certain types of sediments such 
as oil shales (11). Tiratsoo (13) recently has 
advanced the theory that it is not the uranium- 
thorium series members which are responsible for 
sedimentary radioactivity. In his opinion the 
radioactive isotope of potassium, K , is chiefly 
responsible for the phenomena observed in sedi¬ 
ments. His evidence for this is shown in chemi¬ 
cal analyses of typical limestones, sandstones 
and shales. These analyses show that the potass¬ 
ium proportion in the three rock types is 1:3.8:8.6. 

These ratios are of the same order as the ratios of 

— P 

radioactivity, measured in terms of grams x 10"" 
of radium per gram of rock, which have been obtained 
by Russell and others. Tiratsoo believes that 
glauconite is one of the chief factors in con¬ 
centrating potassium in sediments. He states that 
analyses show that glauconite contains about 5% 
potassium, hence a bed with 25% glauconite would 
be composed of 1.25% potassium. Although the 
radioactive component forms only 0.011% of the 
total potassium content, it would form a much 
greater part of a sediment than any other radio¬ 


active element

Present Work 

The top of the Colorado shale in Alberta, 
and elsewhere, is marked by the occurrence of a zone 
of white, calcareous specks. This zone varies slightly 
in thickness between 50 and 100 feet, but is a very 
constant horizon over the whole of the western 
plains. The "White Specks", as the zone is called, 
form;'an excellent marker horizon widely used in 
drilling oil wells. 

When radioactivity surveys are run through 
the White Speck pone it is found that it exhibits 
a high degree of radioactivity, far above normal 
for the marine shales of the area. (Figure 1-1). 

This is rather peculiar because ealcite, with the 
exception of a few limestones, is noticeably low 
on the radioactivity scale. (Table 1-1). The pre¬ 
sent work is an attempt to explain this apparent 
anomaly, and to determine if possible, the source 
of the radioactivity exhibited. 

Unfortunately the writer was not able 
to obta5.n samples of cores or bit cuttings from 
a well on which a radioactivity survey had been 
run. However, as the zone exhibits abnormal, 
though erratic, radioactivity in all the logs 
the writer has in his possession, any samples

would be expected to be of value In the study. 

As just mentioned, the logs of the White 
Speck zone from different wells show a very erratic 
distribution of radiation "highs". The peak de¬ 
flection may be near the top of the zone in one 
well, toward the middle in another, as in Figure 
1-1, and near the bottom of the zone in a third. 

The writer has no explanation for this variation 
in radioactivity peaks. 

Methods of Study 
Sampling: 

Samples for this study are from a wild¬ 
cat well, Imperial Youngstown No. 1, located in 
Legal Subdivision 5, of Section 3, Township 30, 
Range 9 West of the fourth Meridian. The First 
White Speck zone of this well is cored with a 2 
inch diameter conventional core bit. The writer 
was not present when samples of the core were 
packed, but presumes them to be representative. 
Unfortunately the complete White Speck zone is not 
represented in the samples, as samples of core 
No. 1 are not present, and the base of the zone 
is not cored. 

Cores numbers 2 and 3, covering an inter¬ 
val of 36 feet are represented in the samples. 






- 9 - 


Three pieces of core per 2 feet 6 inches (approx¬ 
imately) interval are packed. 

The writer also has bit cutting samples 
from two other wells. The sample intervals, how¬ 
ever, are erratic, and the samples are badly con¬ 
taminated with cavings and drilling mud, hence 
they were not used in this thesis. 

Crushing: 

A representative powder sample of each 
sample interval of the cores is obtained in the 
following manner. A fragment, approximately the 
same size, of each piece of core per interval is 
broken off and placed in a mortar. The three 
pieces are then pulverized together until the 
resultant powder passes a Tyler Standard 100 
mesh screen, (0.15 millimetre opening). This 
method ensures a uniform mixing of the three 
fragments’ powder, and thus a uniform sample. 

Heavy Mineral Separation: 

A portion of each powdered sample, enough 
to fill a 2 gram planchette is used in the heavy 
mineral separation. Flashed bromoform of specific 
gravity greater than 2.7 (calcite) constitutes 
the heavy liquid. The technique of separation 
is that described by Krumbein and Pettijohn (7).

The separated fractions are then tested for their 
radioactivity* 

Radioactivity Measurements: 

The radioactivity measurements made by 
the writer were carried out using a Geiger Mueller 
counter tube. The tube was enclosed in a box 
lined with 2 inches of lead. The instrument and 
counters were built by Mr. A.J. Goodjohn and des¬ 
cribed by him (4). 

Three readings were taken, where possible, 
on each sample interval, the bulk, heavy and light 
fractions each being investigated. Enough of the 
sample under investigation to fill a 2 gram plan- 
chette half full, where this was possible, was 
placed under the tube. The radiations of the 
sample were then counted for a period of one-half 
hour. Background counts were taken at the beginning 
and the end of each period during which several 
samples may have been measured. It was found 
that over a period of three or four hours the 
background did not vary greatly. 

Errors: 

Errors in the measurements were chiefly 
confined to statistical fluctuations. Instrumental 
error occasioned by two superimposed radiations

being counted as one by the instrument were not 
taken into account because the radiation intens¬ 
ities were so low that this situation was consid¬ 
ered practically non-existent. The errors occas¬ 
ioned by the statistical fluctuations were com¬ 
puted by taking the square root of the total 
number of radiations for the period of time the 
measurement took. These calculations were made 
for background and sample measurements. The re¬ 
sultant errors were then divided by the respective 
time intervals so that the error per minute was 
obtained in each case. In calculating the net 
sample counts per minute, the errors of back¬ 
ground and sample counts were additive. 

Examination of Samples: 

The core samples were examined under a 
binocular microscope for their lithologic char¬ 
acter. The description of the samples are con¬ 
tained in Appendix 1-A. 

Immersion mounts were made of the heavy 
and light mineral fractions, and these were ex¬ 
amined under a petrographic microscope. In gen¬ 
eral, the grains were too small for identification, 

the majority appearing to be opaque. In many 
samples the heavy mineral fraction amounted to

only a few grains. Table 1-3 shows the minerals 
identified in the heavy and light fractions, and 
their relative abundance. 

Results 

A summary of the radioactivity measure¬ 
ments of the powdered core samples is contained 
in Table 1-2. The sample reference numbers used 
represent the core intervals described in Appendix 

1-A. 

The minerals identified in the petro¬ 
graphic studies of the powdered samples are con¬ 
tained in Table 1-3 along with their relative 
abundance. 

Discussion of Results 

‘The radiation intensities of the samples 
measured by the Geiger counter are, on the whole, 
too low to be of any significance. A glance at 
Table 1-2 will show that in the majority of eases 
the errors occasioned by the statistical fluctu¬ 
ations are equal to or exceed the net sample counts. 
The instrument used was designed to measure the 
radiations of more highly radioactive substances 
which give thousands of counts per minute. It Is 
therefore not adequately shielded from the cosmic 







- 13 - 


background for studying sediments whose total 
counts are of the same order, or less than the 
background. 

Table 1-3 shows several minerals which 
are possible sources of radioactivity. In the 
light mineral fraction the substance tentatively 
identified as bitumen in the petrographic study 
and also seen In the core samples (Appendix 1-A) 
could be responsible for the intensities shown on 
the radioactivity log. Bell, Goodman, and White¬ 
head (1) report that crude oil samples analysed 
by them have a great affinity for radon, some 
samples containing up to 20 times as much absorbed 

radon as would be expected from the amount of rad¬ 
ii 

ium in the surrounding beds. Dr. A.J. Goodman 
states that photomicrographs of the White Speck 
zone show streaks of bituminous material. In his 
opinion the bitumen may explain the radioactivity. 

In the heavy mineral fraction of the 
samples abundant flakes of biotite occur, through¬ 
out the section. In some core samples these flakes 
are so numerous and large that they are visible to 
the naked eye. (Samples IY2D, IY3D). The writer 
picked enough of these flakes out of the core to

cover the bottom of a planchette and attempted 
to measure their radiation. However the instru¬ 
ment gave very erratic readings and it is suspected 
that some contaminating material was present. 

Since biotite consists of 11.2$ KgO, (5), it 
would be expected to contain a relatively high 
proportion of the radioactive isotope of potassium. 

The wide variation of the biotitic phases of the 
core samples might also account for the fluctuations 
shown by the gamma ray logs. 

A third possible source of radioactivity 
is glauconite. While it was recognized under the 
petrographic microscope in one sample only, and 
in the core samples in rare instances, there is the 
possibility that it exists in sufficient quantities 
as it does in the basal Lea Park (8), to affect 
the total radioactivity of the section. 

Conclusions 

1. The radioactivity of the First White Speckled 
shale zone is not sufficient to be studied on the 
surface by means of a Geiger Counter tube unless 
special shielding devices are placed about the 
instrument to eliminate cosmic ray background. 

2. There are two and perhaps three possible sources 
of the radioactivity observed in the zone. These 
are (a) bitumen, (b) biotite, (c) possibly

glauconite . 

It is the writer’s opinion that the 
problem of the source of radioactivity in the 
White Speck zone merits further study. For this 
purpose it is suggested that a Geiger counter tube 
equipped with a sample sleeve similar to that 
described by Tiratsoo (12) and adequately shielded, 
be constructed. 

While there is no evidence at present 
that the White Specks, themselves, and the radio¬ 
activity of the zone are bound together, it is 
peculiar that the section of their occurrence is 
marked by an extreme deflection of the gamma ray 
curve. Perhaps if the source of the radioactivity 
of the zone can be determined, the problem of the 
origin of the specks will have a definite light 
thrown upon it.

PART TWO 

COMPARATIVE STUDY OP THE RADIOACTIVITY AND 
ELECTRIC LOG-S FOR CERTAIN FORMATIONS OF THE 
REDWATER OIL FIELD 


Introduction 

Although much has been written on the 
theories, procedures, and practical applications 
of radioactivity and electric well logging, few 
papers have actually compared or contrasted the 
two methods (3,9,10)^, and fewer still, beyond 
pointing out a similarity in the profiles of the 
curves, have attempted a correlation between the 
curves, or a study of the possible errors in 
determining the tops of formations from the logs. 
G.F. Shepherd (13) has shown the correlation of 
horizons on the two types of logs relative to the 
bottom of the drill hole, for use in selecting 
suitable locations for perforating casing. 

Scope of Work 

The writer has attempted in this paper 
to establish a correlation between radioactivity 
logs, electric logs, and the accepted depths of 
formations. This has been done by a comparative 
study of the gamma ray curve of the radioactivity

log and the potential curve of the electric log 
for four formations in the Redwater Oil Field, 
and their respective relations to the depths of these 
formations as published in the Schedule of Wells 
and Weekly Reports of the Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Conservation Board. 

Well Logging and Well hogging Instruments 

In order that the reader may appreciate 
more fully the information contained in the two 
types of well logs, a brief description of the 
instruments and methods used in logging follows. 
Radioactivity Well Logging: 

A typical set-up at the well head for 
carrying out a radioactivity survey Is shown in 
Figure 2-1. 

For the purpose of this thesis, a radio¬ 
activity log Is considered to be the gamma ray, or 
natural radioactivity curve only, and the neutron 
or artificially induced radioactivity curve is not 
discussed except briefly in a later section. The 
instruments in the following descriptions are used 
in obtaining the gamma ray curve, although they 
are also applicable to the neutron curve almost 
in their entirety. 

Instrumentation: 


The essential instrument in the well

logging apparatus is the ionization chamber and 
its associated batteries and amplifiers. (Fig¬ 
ure 2-2). These are contained in a heavy metal 
cylinder 10 feet 8 inches long and approximately 
3 5/8 inches in diameter. The walls of this 
cylinder are necessarily thick to withstand any 
pressure which might be met in a bore hole. 
Instruments in use at the present time will with¬ 
stand a maximum pressure of 12,500 pounds per 
square inch. The thick walls also serve another 
purpose in that they allow only the most pene¬ 
trating radiations to enter the ionization chamber 
thus they act as a selective filter in the logging 
of the well. 

The Ionization chamber, located in the 
bottom of the cylinder, is 3 feet long. It is 
filled with 99.9 per cent pure argon gas under 
high pressure. Two insulated electrodes are 
imbedded in the chamber and are connected to 
batteries contained in another part of the cyl¬ 
inder. Under normal conditions no current will 
flow through the argon when an electrical pot¬ 
ential is placed on the electrodes. When the 
chamber Is exposed to gamma rays, however, the 
gas becomes partially ionized and permits the 
flow of the current. It should be noted that it

is not the radiations themselves which cause the 
current, they only ionize the gas. 

Radioactive minerals form only an ex¬ 
tremely small part of the sediments and their 
gamma radiations, which affect the ionization 
chamber, are proportionately small in number. 

Hence only a very small current flows between the 
electrodes. The intensity of this current varies 
directly as the ionization of the gas in the 
chamber which, in turn is proportional to the 
intensity of the gamma ray bombardment. 

The variations in the current passing 
through the ionization chamber are also extremely 
small, about one ten trillionth of an ampere. 
Amplifiers in the body of the bore hole instrument 
amplify these variations immensely. They are 
then sent up to the surface through a co-axial 
cable. This same cable is used to raise and lower 
the instrument in the hole. 

The instrument truck, to which the 
amplified current variations are sent, contains 
further amplifiers, a sensitivity control, time 
constant control, and an automatic pen recorder 
which produces a log of the variations on a 
moving roll of paper. 






- 22 - 


The sensitivity control sets the horizon¬ 
tal deflection of the pen recorder for a given rad¬ 
iation intensity. It is usually set before the 
instrument is lowered into the bore hole although 
the operator may change the setting while logging 
is in progress. To set the control a reference 
bottle containing a gamma ray source of known 
intensity is placed next to the ionization chamber 
and the deflection of the pen recorder for this 
bottle is noted and set for the conditions likely 
to be encountered in the hole. If the section to 
be logged is weakly radioactive, or if the contrasts 
in the radioactivity of the strata are slight, the 
sensitivity of the instrument Is increased. Con¬ 
versely, if the section is strongly radioactive, 
the sensitivity is reduced. The reference line Is 
always placed at the top of the log, an arrow with 
a figure indicating the deflection in inches. 

The intensity of the gamma rays affecting 
the instrument at any given depth in a well is not 
constant, but fluctuates due to the chance dis¬ 
integrations of the radioactive substances. If 
these variations are measured over a very short 
time interval they will be very large. However, 
as the time interval is increased the variations 
will become progressively smaller, tending to

approach a fixed average. 

If the pen of the automatic recorder 
were allowed to respond to each variation in rad¬ 
iation intensity it would record a rapid succession 
of peaks and lows which would have no marked re¬ 
lation to the over all radioactivity of the for¬ 
mation surveyed. This effect is eliminated by 
a device called the time constant control which 
averages the variations over a suitable time inter¬ 
val. The proper setting of the control depends 
principally on the speed at which the logging is done, 
and to a degree, on the sensitivity used. If a 
section is surveyed at 22 feet per minute (the 
normal logging speed in Alberta), the ionization 
chamber would be affected by a thin stratum for 
about 1C seconds, and the time constant control 
would be s et to average the variations over this 
period. If the logging speed were reduced to 11 
feet per minute, the averaging period would be 
twice as long. The log produced is a smoother 
curve, reflecting the characteristic radioactivity 
of a formation rather than the individual variations 
for thin strata. The time constant control in use 
at the present time is pre-set before the instrument 
Is taken into the field. 

The log produced is recorded on a 
continuous roll of loggihg paper synchronized to

the movement of the bore hole instrument by means 
of a transmission drive from the hoist truck. 

The depth of the instrument in the hole 

. ad' 

is measured by the measuring sheave, centered over 
the well opening, and is indicated electrically 
on an odometer dial in the instrument truck. The 
measuring sheave has a self contained adjustment 
feature which compensates for the wear of the 
sheave rim and the cable. A further check on the 
depth accuracy is available by means of metal flags 
set at known intervals along the length of the cable. 
The Gamma Hay Log: 

A typical gamma ray log is shown in 
Figure 2-3. It will be noticed that no definite 
values of radiation intensity are given. This is 
because the log is qualitative rather than quant¬ 
itative. If one knows the radiation intensity of 
the reference bottle which produced the deflection 
shown, then a quantitative measure of the radio¬ 
activity could be made. This information, however, 

Is confidential at the present time and has not yet 
been released by Lane Wells Co. Ltd. 

Electric Well Logging: 

Earth potentials were observed for the 
first time more than one hundred years ago by the 
Englishman R.W. Fox who made potential measure¬ 
ments in a mine shaft in Cornwall (3). Since the

beginning of the twentieth century this phenomenon 
has been used extensively in surface exploration 
and mining, and applied even to geological problems. 
The possibility of finding electrical potentials 
in bore holes, however, seems to have been over¬ 
looked during the early years of electric well 
logging, and it was only after several years that 
it was realized that significant potentials were 
generated in the bore hole itself. These potentials 
can be classified in the two following groups: 

(1) The potentials which are found in the ground 
even when no bore hole exists. They can be observed 
in mines, shafts, and holes containing no drilling 
fluid, and are considered to be contact potentials 
occurring between different beds of sedimentary 
formations. They are called natural potentials. 

(2) The potentials found in bore holes containing 
drilling fluids. These seem to be caused by one 
main factor, electrochemical reactions, similar to 
those of a concentration cell. These potentials are 
called secondary potentials. 

A detailed discussion on the theories 
of these potentials and their application in elec¬ 
tric logging can be found in Guyod*s excellent 
series of articles on the subject, (3,4) and other 
publications (12).

thesis are confined to the spontaneous potential 
curve as this corresponds closely in profile to the 
gamma ray curve of the radioactivity log (Figures 
2-3 and 2-5). 

Instrumentation: 

The well head set-up for making an elec¬ 
trical survey is similar to that shown in Figure 2-1 
for a radioactivity survey except that no separate 
instrument truck is used. The instruments, recorder 
and hoist apparatus are all contained in the one 
truck. The equipment used consists of a sonde, a 
cable, a control panel containing the necessary 
circuits, a pulsator, and a photographic recorder. 

In addition, batteries or a direct current gener¬ 
ator are carried to serve as a source of current 
in recording the resistivity. 

The sonde is a system of electrodes, 
mounted on an Insulated mandrel, which Is lowered 
into the hole on the end of the cable, to which it 
is connected by means of a threaded sleeve. The 
cable passes over a sheave at the surface, located 
above the hole, and in order to raise or lower 
the sonde in the hole, the cable is wound or un¬ 
wound on a winch, set permanently on the truck and 
driven by the engine of the truck. The various 
electrodes of the sonde are connected by means of 
Insulated conductors in the cable, through a slip

ring collector on the winch, to the appropriate 
terminals of the circuits in the truck. 

The pulsator is used to convert direct 
current to a pulsated current. This device en¬ 
ables the resistivity curves to be recorded at 
the same time as the potential curve. 

The cable used in modern electric well 
logging operations is a six-conductor, armored 
cable. This cable can be used in logging the deep¬ 
est holes and permits many combinations of electrode 
arrangements to bring out particular properties 
desired. 

The actual measurements of potentials 
and resistivities are made by recording galvan¬ 
ometers equipped with small mirrors. A photo¬ 
graphic film is exposed by narrow beams of light 
reflected from, these mirrors. The deflection of 
each beam on the film is proportional to the po¬ 
tential difference being recorded by that galvan¬ 
ometer. The circuits in the recorder are adjusted 
so that suitable sensitivity scales for the po¬ 
tential and resistivity curves are obtained. The 
film is made to move in the recorder in synchro¬ 
nism with the movement of the sonde along the hole. 
Each light beam traces on the film a curve, which 
at a position corresponding to a given depth of 
the sonde, has an amplitude indicative of the

magnitude of the potential or resistivity measured 
at that depth. 

The usual logging speed is about 6000 
feet per hour in Alberta, and curves with good 
definition may be obtained at this speed. 

The Spontaneous Potential Log: 

The spontaneous potential curve is a record 
of the naturally-occurring potentials measured in 
the mud at different depths in a drill hole. It 
is, in effect, a record of the potential differences 
between a stationary electrode, N located at the 
surface and at a fixed potential, and a moving 
electrode, M, whose potential varies as it moves 
along the hole. The potential differences are 
observed by means of a recording galvanometer. 

Figure 2-4 is a schematic diagram of this operation. 

According to the circuit shown in 
Figure 2-4, it can be seen that the recording galvan¬ 
ometer measures all the differences of potential 
between the electrodes. However, when the proper 
precautions are taken, experience has shown that, 
under normal conditions, the deflections on the 
potential log correspond to the phenomena occurring 
at the contacts between the mud and the different 
beds, and also at the contacts between the beds 
themselves. These phenomena produce an electric 
current which uses the mud as its return path. In 


























. 









































































































































doing so, it creates in the mud, by ohmic effect, 
potential differences which can be measured and 
plotted against corresponding depths to produce 
the potential log. 

A typical potential curve of the electric 
log is shown in Figure 2-5. It will be noticed 
that no definite potential in millivolts is given 
on the scale. This is quite consistent with the 
fact that the curve is qualitative and not quant¬ 
itative in aspect. The vertical lines represent 
a potential difference of 20 millivolts. Thus one 
can compute the difference in potential between 
adjacent formations. In practice, the curve in 
front of a shale formation is taken as the base line, 
and potential differences of other type of strata 
are referred to this line. In Alberta a conven¬ 
ient reference line is the curve representing the 
Colorado shale (not shown In this figure). 

General Relation of Radioactivity and Electric Logs 

The gamma ray curve of the radioactive 
log and the potential curve of the electric log 
are much alike in profile, as a glance at Figures 
2-3 and 2-5 will show. The only explanation for 
this at present is the fact that the gamma log 
shows deflections right or left as a formation 
is more radioactive (shale, silt) or less radio- 





- 30 - 


active (sand, limestone). 

The potential log similarly shows de¬ 
flections toward the positive side, the right, for 
impervious beds (shale, silt) and toward the neg¬ 
ative side, the left, for permeable beds (sand, 
limestone). Russell (11) has shown there is a 
direct relation between the permeability of the 
rock and its radioactivity. Using sand as an 
example he shows that the radioactivity increases 
as the permeability decreases. 

Since increasing radioactivity on the 
gamma ray log, and decreasing permeability on the 
potential log cause both curves to deflect to the 
right, this explains, in some measure, the simi- 
larity. It must be remembered, however, that the 
two curves represent very different physical 
characteristics. 

Within a formation the gamma ray log 
records the changes in lithology In much more detail 
than the potential curve, as Is shown In Figures 
2-3 and 2-5. 'This, no doubt, is because the gamma 
ray curve is a measurement of a fundamental property 
of the rock in a formation and responds to each 
slight change in lithology, while the potential 
curve measures the potential differences which are 
greatest at formation contacts, but are not notice-

able within a relatively homogeneous formation. 

A comparison of the Ireton profile of the two log 
types will show this difference clearly. 

Lithologic Description of Formations Used 

This study of the radioactivity and 
electric logs for the Redwater Field is confined 
to four Paleozoic horizons, the Calmar and Nisku 
members of the Winterburn formation, and the 
Ireton and Leduc members of the Woodbend formation. 
A lithologic description of these members Is con¬ 
tained In Table 2-1. 

Errors in Logging the Tops of Formations 

From the foregoing lithologic description 
of the horizons used, in this study. It is apparent 
that they differ appreciably in composition. These 
differences appear in their responses, both in 
electrical and radioactivity logging, as can be 
seen in Figures 2-3 and 2-5, causing the character¬ 
istic profile of each member to appear on the log 
well separated from adjacent members. 

The ideal log of the formations, whether 
radioactive or potential, would have a straight 
horizontal line joining the profiles of adjacent 

formations at their contacts, and this straight 
horizontal line would merely represent the de- 






- 32 - 


flection of the recorder pen in registering the 
differences in potentials or radiation intensities 
of the two formations. This line would be a true 
”transition” line. 

The ideal is impossible in both types of 
logging for several reasons. In both cases the 
recording pen lags behind the impulses of the bore 
hole instrument. Hence, in moving from one de¬ 
flection on the log to another, the movement of 
the paper will bend the transition line off hori¬ 
zontal. This factor Is important In electric logging 
where the potential measuring electrodes may be 
considered as a point, as It is really the only 
factor preventing a horizontal transition line at 
formation contacts. 

A second factor which occurs in making 
a radioactivity log, and tends to put the transition 
line off from horizontal, is the length of the 
ionization chamber. Since this chamber is three 
feet long it Introduces a vertical error. As the 
chamber passes from one formation to the next it 
is affected by the radiations of the succeeding 
formation in ever Increasing measure, and con¬ 
versely, the formation left behind affects it less 
and less. It Is easily seen that the full radiation 
of the formation entered will not affect the ion- 





- 33 - 


ization chamber until it has passed through a 
distance of three feet. The transition line thus 
acquires a further slant. The time constant control, 
in averaging out the changing radiation intensities 
at formation contacts, smoothes the transition line. 
However, if it is not set exactly to the logging 
speed it will either cause a further lag, if set 
to average over too short a period, or will make 
the transition line jagged and almost illegible. 

The time constant control in use today is preset 
to a logging speed of approximately 60 feet per 
minute, and as the logging of the section under 
study is done at from 22 to 28 feet per minute, 
a further lag is introduced into the pen recorder. 

The sum total of these pen lags is not great, 
rarely causing the vertical separation to be more 
than four feet. However, an occasional log shows 
a separation of up to 10 feet. 

Methods of Study 

Determination of Formation Tops From Logs: 

The determination of formation tops from 
a radioactivity log depends, to some extent, on 
individual interpretation. Several methods are 
advocated, one being that the correct position 
of the contact plane is found at a point one 
third the distance from the maximum peak to the

minimum peak of adjacent profiles. Another method 
is to determine the point midway on the transition 
line (6, 13). Prom the foregoing discussion on the 
ionization chamber’s passage from one formation to 
the next, it would appear that when the midpoint 
of the chamber is opposite the contact, the corr¬ 
esponding point on the transition line should be 
taken as the correct depth of the contact. It is 
also apparent that If the time constant control is 
set correctly, or nearly correctly, this point 
should be half-way along the transition line. 

On an electric log the contact plane 
between two formations is represented by an in¬ 
flection point in the potential curve,(4). It was 
observed by the writer that this point occurs half 
way along the transition line of this curve in the 
majority of logs. 

To obtain uniformity In the work, the 
same method of determining tops of formations is 
used on both types of logs. This method Is ill¬ 
ustrated in Figures 2-6 and 2-7. The transition 
line of the gamma ray curve Is usually a straight 
line, and Is picked out quite easily from the pro¬ 
file curve. Vertical lines (a) are drawn from each 
end of the transition line and the horizontal dis¬ 
tance between them, is measured. Prom, the mid¬ 
point (b) between the end points of the transition

line a vertical line (c) is drawn to intersect 
the transition line. The point of intersection 
is then projected horizontally (d) to the scale 
on the side of the log and the depth read to the 
nearest foot, except in cases where it is exactly 
on the half foot. As the scale of the log is 2 
inches equal 100 feet, a 50:1 engineer 1 s rule is 
used. 

The transition line of the potential 
curve is not so distinct as that of the gamma ray 
curve, and for this reason the points where the 
line flattened out from the characteristic pro¬ 
files of formations are considered to be the end 
points. The procedure of determining the mid¬ 
point of the transition line, and the reading of 
the depth of this point is the same as for the 
gamma ray curve. In some of the wells used in 
this study, the hole was not drilled deep enough 
into the Leduc Member before the electric log was 
taken to allow the potential curve its full de¬ 
flection. The transition line is therefore 
only partially represented on the log. The top 
of the Leduc Member is taken from the resistivity 
curve in these cases, as is shown in Figure 2-7. 

Frequent checks are necessary to ensure 
that the point of intersection of the vertical 
line (c) and the transition line coincide with

th© midpoint of the gamma ray transition line, 
and the inflection point of the potential curve. 

Results 

Radioactivity and electric logs of 85 
wells in the Redwater Field are used in this study. 
The tops of the four previously mentioned formations 
are determined and presented in Tables 2-2 and 2-3 
of Appendix 2-A. The locations of the wells used, 
together with their identifying reference numbers, 
are plotted on the map of the Redxvater Field found 
in the poeket on the inside back cover. An index 
of wells is found in Appendix 2-B. 

Disctisslon of Results 

In the following discussion reference 
is made only to Table 2-2. However, the remarks 
apply also to Table 2-3. 

Columns 2 and 3 in Table 2-2 show the 
total depth of the well as recorded by the driller 
and radioactivity log respectively. Before a 
survey Is taken the drill pipe is "measured out 
of the hole" by the drilling crew. This consists 
of measuring each length of pipe as it Is removed 
from the hole and is stacked in the derrick. The 
measurement is usually quite accurate as it must 
agree with the pipe tally, kept while drilling 
is in progress. There may be a certain amount of 









- 37 - 


error in this measurement as the pipe hanging in 
the hole is bound to stretch somewhat and the 
stretch cannot be taken into account in the 
measurement. It is the writer f s opinion, however, 
that this error is not appreciable. In this thesis 
the driller’s depth is taken as the true depth of 
the hole. 

Good drilling practice demands that the 
mud in the drill hole be circulated for at least 
one hour before a survey is run. This Is to clear 
the hole and remove any cavings from its bottom, 
and the mud. It Is assumed here that the practice 
has been followed in the wells used. Any dis¬ 
crepancy between the driller’s depth and the radio¬ 
activity log depth, therefore, is an error on the 
part of the logging apparatus, or the operator of 
the apparatus. 

The difference between the driller’s depth 
and radioactivity log depth is shown in column 4 
under Correction Factor (CF). The plus figures 
indicate the driller’s depth is greater than the 
log depth, and the minus figures indicate that 
the log depth is greater. It is reasoned that, 
if the radioactivity log depth is greater than the 
driller’s (or true) depth, then the error will also 
be found in the depths at which the log shows the 


formation contacts. Thus, if a radioactivity log

shows a hole to be 4003 feet deep while it is really 
4000 feet, and a formation contact is shown to be 
at 3003 feet on the log, it is assumed that the 
log is 3 feet too deep here also. Thus the true 
depth of the formation is 3000 feet. The correction 
factor in this case would be -3 feet. 

The correction factor found in each well 
is applied to the depths of the contacts determined 
from the log and is recorded in its appropriate 
column. 

The accepted depths of the formation con¬ 
tacts, as given in the Schedule of Wells Drilled for 
Oil and Gas to 1949, and Weekly Reports of the 
Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation 
Board, are shown in co3.umns 7,10,13 and 16 of 
Tables 2-2 and 2-3. These are used as the standard 
with which to compare the accuracy of the radio¬ 
activity and electric logs. It would be preferable 
to have cored depths of contacts in wells where 
this is possible, or accurate sample depths, for 
comparison; however this information Is not ob¬ 
tainable. The Board determinations are made by 
using electric logs. When a contact depth is de¬ 
termined this depth Is checked in the samples of 
the bit cuttings for that well and any necessary 
correction made to the original depth determination. 
It is rather unfortunate that the electric logs

are used in the determination as this introduces 
the possibility that the comparisons are merely 
between the writer 1 s and another person’s inter¬ 
pretation of the logs. Of course the sample 
check gives some control over the accuracy. 

Table 2-4 is a detailed tabulation of the 
differences between the two types of logs, and 
between each log type and the Conservation Board 
figures. Two sets of standard deviations of the 
various readings are shown at the base of each 
column, together with the number of wells used 
for the particular determination. These are 
summarized in Table 2-5. 

These two sets of standard deviations 
are necessary because of the large deviation of 
certain of the readings. One example might be 
Well 10 14. In this well the uncorrected radio¬ 
activity depth of the Leduc Member varies from 
the electric log depth of the same Member by 19 
feet. The corrected depths vary by 16 feet. An 
inspection of the rest of the wells shows that, 
with a few exceptions, the variation is on the 
order of from 1 to 5 feet. Thus, if the variation 
of 10 14 and other wells like it were included in 
the total deviation calculations, the standard 
deviations would be abnormally large, and would 
not reflect the true state of affairs. The writer 



- 40 - 


aet an arbitrary limit of plus or minus 15 feet 
as the maximum deviation allowed, and the first 
set of standard deviations (SD]J are calculated 
with this in mind. The readings deleted in cal¬ 
culating this set are marked with an asterisk. 

The second set of standard deviations (SDg) are 
calculated using all the deviations irregardless 
of amplitude, and show the effect of the few wells 
deleted in the first set of calculations. 

Relation of Radioactivity and Electric Log 
Determinations: 

One would expect, from the discussion 
of the correction factor above, that the standard 
deviation of the corrected radioactivity and 
electric logs would be less than that of the un¬ 
corrected log. Table 2-5 shows that the opposite 
is true in all cases. This shows that there must 
be an error in the assumption discussed. This 
error could arise from several sources: (a) There 
could be cavings in the hole holding the logging 
instrument off bottom. If this is the case then 
the correction factor of a plus figure has no re¬ 
lation to the contacts of the formation as logged; 
(b) The instrument might get stuck in the hole 
above bottom. Usually this occurs far enough 
off bottom to be obvious; (c) The driller ! s 
depth might be wrong. Of these three possibilities 
the first is the most likely to be the cause of an

error. If then , we say that all cases where the 
logging apparatus has registered the bottom of the 
hole at shallower depths than the driller, are due 
to cavings in the hole bottom, the only errors in 
the logs are when they register total depths greater 
than the driller T s. 

It is not the writer’s opinion that in 
all cases, where the logging apparatus shows a 
hole depth less than the driller’s, that the hole 
bottom has a layer of cavings, and that there is 
no log error. There is, however, no way of telling 
which holes are caved and which ones are not. If 
then, we omit all the holes in which the logged 
depth is less than the true depth, and consider 
only those holes in which the logged depth is 
greater than the driller’s depth, we obtain the 
results shown in Table 2-6. 

Only those wells in which the correction 
factor is minus, or zero, in both radioactivity 
and electric logs, are used in the comparison of 
the logs with each other. All logs showing minus 
correction factors are used for comparison with 
the accepted depth. 

If Table 2-6 is compared to Table 2-5, 
it is seen that the deviations of the corrected 
logs in the Leduc and Ireton Members is reduced, 
while those of the Nisku and Calraar Members are 






- 42 - 


increased slightly. It should also be noted that 
the deviations of the uncorrected logs for the 
first two mentioned members is unchanged, while those 
of the second two are increased materially. The 
overall result of this is to reduce the deviation 
of the corrected logs. This is shown in the stand¬ 
ard deviation of the total readings where, in the 
case of the corrected logs, the deviation is re¬ 
duced, and for the uncorrected logs increased 
slightly. 

No doubt some of the wells having posi¬ 
tive correction factors also were logged to total 
depth without interference from cavings. However, 
as mentioned before. It is impossible to pick these 
wells out. The writer is convinced that, if they 
were Included, the deviations of the corrected logs 
would be even less. Until such time as the logging 
instruments have some means of indicating whether 
they are at the well bottom, stuck up the hole, 
or in cavings, a correction may be reliably applied 
only to those cases with a minus correction factor. 

The logs having minus or zero correction 
factors show another feature. This is the constancy 
of the plus or minus deviation between the corr¬ 
ected logs for a formation. Of the thirty readings 
of the Leduc formation, twenty-four or 80 percent 
of the readings show the radioactivity log recording

higher than the electric log. The Ireton readings 
produce the opposite results - the radioactivity- 
log recording deeper than the electric log in 
25 out of 29 readings, or in 86$ of the readings. 
The radioactivity log again records the Nisku top 
shallower than the electric log in 90$ of the 
readings. The Calmar readings are divided, the 
radioactivity log showing 13 tops deeper, and 11 
tops shallower than the electric log. The Calmar 
readings are therefore unreliable as they show no 
pattern. This feature might be used in testing 
the log to see if a correction factor is needed, 
or can be applied. If the corrected depth follows 
the pattern mentioned above for the three lower 
formations, then the correction is probably all 
right. 

A possible explanation for the observed 
pattern in the three deeper formations can be ob¬ 
tained by a consideration of the electrical po¬ 
tential developed around a, shale-limestone contact. 
The Leduc-Ireton contact may be taken as an example. 
(Figure 2-8). 

It has been shown experimentally (3,12) 
that the current at such a contact flows from the 
shale through the mud and back into the limestone 
or dolomite as the case may be. If the resist¬ 
ances of the two rock types were approximately 



- 44 - 


the same, the current paths would form a series 
of ellipses. The resistance of limestone, how¬ 
ever, is many times that of shale and this re¬ 
sistance actually repulses the current lines. 
Instead of flowing in the regular elliptical 
patterns, the current is repulsed by the Leduc 
limestone in the bore hole below the boundary. 

This effect straightens the current lines sit¬ 
uated in the bore hole below the contact and 
lengthens the path the current follows in the m.ud 
column. Therefore, there is still an appreciable 
amount of current flowing in the bore hole several 
feet below the boundary, which means the potential 
drop will be observed for a relatively long section 
in this zone. The effect also decreases the po¬ 
tential gradient opposite the limestone bed so 
that the log has a more rounded shape below the 
contact. This effect occurs at the contacts of 
each of the three lower members studied in this 
thesis with the results shown in Figure 2-8. 

The inflection point of the potential 
log is still opposite the shale-limestone contact, 
but the rounding of the curve in the limestone 
section obscures this point. The result is a 
straightened portion of the potential log trans¬ 
ition line covering a vertical distance of several 
feet. The contact of the formations may be 


. 

* 

































. ■ 

. 







- 45 - 


picked anywhere along this portion of the curve. 

The writer, using the method of contact deter¬ 
mination described previously, found that in every 
case the mid-point of the log line fell with5.n 
this straightened portion of the potential curve. 

From the foregoing discussion one can 
realize that the determination of a shale-lime- 
stone contact may vary by several feet unless a 
very great deal of care is used to find the in¬ 
flection point, if it is possible to find this point 
at all. The radioactivity log, on the other hand, 
is affected only by the difference in the radiation 
intensity of the formations, and the mid-point of 
the transition line is usually a very accurate 
determination of the formation contact. It is 
the writer*s opinion, therefore, that the gamma 
ray log gives more accurate contact determinations 
than the electric logs for the formations used in 
this thesis. 

Relation of Radioactivity and Electric Logs to 
Accepted Depths: 

The Conservation Board*s method of de¬ 
termining the tops of formations has been dis¬ 
cussed previously. As might be expected, the 
standard deviation of the electric log depths is 
less than that of the radioactivity log depths. 

A rather surprising feature is the close agree- 























; f •

men t of most of the determinations of the writer 
with those of the Board. In a few cases such as 
IS 22, and IS 24, where the writer's contact de¬ 
termination by the potential curves and gamma 
ray curves agree closely with each other, but 
differ appreciably from the Board determinations, 
it is apparent that the Board figures are wrong. 
These readings have therefore been left out of 
the deviation calculations (SD-j.) . 

The deviation of the Calmar contact, as 
picked from gamma ray and potential curves by the 
writer, from the Board figures, appear to be some¬ 
what higher than normal (Table 2-5). This is due 
no doubt, to.the Board's having samples to correct 
their readings with in wells where the top of the 
Calmar is eroded, while the writer's figures are 
from log determinations only. 

Relation of Radioactivity Log Determinations 
to Board Depths: 

As can be seen from Table 2-5, in gen¬ 
eral, the determinations from the gamma ray curve 
agree closely with the accepted depth. The max¬ 
imum error shown in the table, excluding the 
Calmar Member is 9.4 feet, and If the Calmar is 
included, 11.1 feet, while the average error is 
less than 8.4 feet. An examination of Table 2-4 
will show that 80$ of the determinations fall 



. 

. 






- 47 - 


within the average standard deviation of 4.2 feet 
from the accepted depth. 

Table 2-6 shows even closer agreement 
between the determinations from the radioactivity- 
logs and the Board figures, the average deviation 
here being 3.8 feet. This is further evidence 
that the minus correction factor indicates that 
an error exists in the log and that a correction 
can safely be applied. 

Relation of Electric Log Determinations and 
Board Depths: 

The electric log determinations show 
very close agreement with Board figures through¬ 
out. The maximum error shown is 10.4 feet in the 
Calmar Member, and the possible reason for this 
has already been discussed. 

The deviations shown in both tables can 
be accounted for by the different interpretation 
of the contact point on the log by different people. 
The Board determinations are done by reading the 
combination of resistivity and potential curve 
profiles, while the writer used the potential 
curve only. The deviation of the Galmar is 
again above normal probably for the reason mentioned 
before. 

Conclusions 


The general conclusions reached as a 















„ 








- 48 - 


result of this study are as follows: 

1. Radioactivity and electric logs are both 
useful in determining the depths of for¬ 
mation contacts. The formation tops re¬ 
corded by the gamma ray log are probably 
more accurate than those determined by 
the spontaneous potential log. 

2. There are errors in both types of logs, 
which, although not great, are discernible. 

3. Correction of log errors is not possible 
in all cases. It is possible in those 
cases in which the logged depth of the 
hole is greater than the true depth. 

4. A pattern of plus and minus deviations 
between the contacts as logged by the 
radioactivity and electric log is observed. 
This suggests that a correction factor 
could be derived and successfully applied 
in correcting both types of logs. 

The conclusions which can be reached 
after a study of this nature are somewhat nebulous, 
due to the lack of a definite standard. The acc¬ 
epted depths (Conservation Board depths) used here 
as that standard, have been shown, in some cases, to 
be in error. Further study, comparing the logged 
contacts to definite cored contact depths. Is 


indicated

Tables 2-2 and 2-3 

Explanation of Tables 

Tables 2-2 and 2-3: 

1. Blank spaces in contact determinations 
Indicate that either the section of the well is 
not represented on the log or the transition line 
of the contact is such that no reliable deter¬ 
mination can be made, 

2. Blank spaces in the Conservation Board 
depths indicate that the well is not listed in 
the reports cited. 

Key to Subhead Symbols: 

Column 1 WRN - Well Reference Number 

2 RDL - Total Depth of well recorded 

on log 

3 TD - Total Depth recorded by driller 

4 CP - Correction Factor 

5.8.11.14 - RD - Depth of Contact 

recorded by log 

6.9.12.15 - CD - Corrected Depth of 

contact 

7,10,13,16- CBD- Depth of Contact re¬ 
corded by Conservation

Table 2-4: 


1. Blank spaces indicate no comparisons are 
possible because one component is missing. 

2. In columns where radioactivity logs are 
compared with electric logs, or Conservation Board 
depths, plus figures indicate the radioactivity 
log contacts are shallower than the other depths. 

3. Where electric log contact depths are 
compared to Conservation Board depths, plus fig¬ 
ures indicate the logged depth is less than Board 
depth. 


4. Figures marked with an asterisk are be¬ 
yond the arbitrary 15 foot limit set for deter¬ 
mining the standard deviations.

The standard deviation SD]_ is found 
using only the deviations of less than 15 feet in 
the Table. SDg is the standard deviation of all 
the readings. The number of readings used in each 
case is shown in the line N.R.

PART THREE 

THE APPLICATION OF THE GAMMA RAY LOG IN CORRELATION 

PROBLEMS 

Introduction 

Radioactivity logs, being a relatively 
new development in geological investigations, have 
not received much attention in correlation work* 

The principal reason for this is that electric 
logs have been on the scene for many more years 
and have been used extensively by the oil industry. 
As a result of this use, most geologists in the 
petroleum field are familiar with the logs and can 
interpret them without undue difficulty. Their 
use in correlation problems has long been known, 
and is pointed out in most of the literature. It 
is suggested here that the gamma ray log, properly 
interpreted, may prove to be an even more valuable 
tool in the problems of short and long range strat¬ 
igraphic correlation in Western Canada. This is 
especially so in the Paleozoic formations. 

Short Range Correlation 

Figure 3-1 (in pocket) shows an example 
of short range correlation within one field. The 
distance represented between the end wells is 15.1 
miles. As can be seen, the contacts of the various 






- 51 - 


horizons are clearly discernible throughout the 
length of the field. Perhaps more important than 
showing the lateral extent of formations, the gamma 
ray log shows changes of lithology within a formation 
quite clearly. It is in this respect that the 
radioactivity log Is of more value than the electric 
log. 

Take, for example, the Nisku Member as 
shown in the section. Near the top of the member 
are two dolomitic silt bands which produce prominent 
deflections in the logs of most of the wells. The 
upper 8 foot band, occurring about 10 feet below 
the top Is quite variable, disappearing in the middle 
of the field. The lower band, occurring about 20 
feet below the top is about 5-10 feet in thickness. 

This is an extensive horizon although varying in 
thickness. It has also been found In the Leduc 
field. 

In the Ireton Member one may trace the 
lensing in and out of the calcareous or dolomitic 
phases of the shale. Thus, in Imperial Opal #18 
there Is a decidedly dolomitic stringer near the 
top of the member. This phase may be traced through 
Opal #9 and Egremont #40, but appears to die out 
after this. Other similar changes In lithology 
can be traced down the length of the field.

The changes in the lithology of the Calmar 
Member are also shown quite clearly. 

Prom the interpretation of these litho- 
facies changes, a picture of the sedimentation of 
an area may be built up, if sufficient sections are 
made, 

Long Range Correlation 

Figure 3-2 (in pocket) is an example of 
the application of gamma ray logs to long range 
correlation. The three northerly wells are in 
the Opal, Redwater and Simmons sectors of the Red- 
water oil field. Imperial Stony Plain No. 1 is a 
wildcat well drilled southwest of Edmonton on the 
southern extremity of what is now called the Acheson 
reef. The three southerly wells are in the Golden 
Spike, Yvoodbend, and Leduc sectors of the Leduc 
oil field. The total distance measured in a straight 
northeast-southwest line between the two extrem¬ 
ities is 54 miles. The location map on the figure 
shows the wide separation of the two groups of wells. 

The correlation of the Upper Devonian 
formational members under discussion betvireen the 
two areas is clearly shown by the gamma ray logs. 

Again, the lithologic variation within 











- 53 - 


formation members is illustrated by the logs. 

Perhaps the most striking example of this is in the 
Ireton Member. In the Redwater area the Nisku- 
Ireton contact is fairly well defined both by the 
log, and in the cores. 

The transition zone between the two for¬ 
mations is small and in many cores the contact is 
visible to the naked eye. In the Leduc area, how¬ 
ever, the Nisku-Ireton contact is not well defined. 
The transition zone is broad, often up to 15 feet. 

The contact is picked from cores at the first 
appearance of argillaceous material in the basal 
Nisku dolomite. Often there are pure or almost 
pure dolomite bands up to 8 feet thick below this 
point in the cores. The Ireton itself in the Leduc 
area is a very impure shale, having calcareous and 
dolomitic bands, partings and fractures. The basal 
portion, however, is usually a fairly clean, slightly 
calcareous shale, and the contact with the Leduc 
Member is sharp and easily seen in core and chip 
samples. 

The gamma ray logs of the Leduc area wells 
show this gradational nature of the member very 
clearly. The gradual increase in argillaceous 
material is well defined in the progressive increase 
in the logs f radiation intensities, culminating In 














- 













- 54 - 


the relatively pure shale* The Ireton-Leduc 
contact is also shown to be sharp. 

The silt band within the Nisku Member, 
mentioned previously in connection with the Red- 
water field, is also visible in logs of the Leduc 
area wells. The band is not developed in the 
Stony Plain well, is poorly developed in the 
Golden Spike sector, is fairly well developed in 
the Woodbend area, and is especially well developed 
in the Leduc sector. It is not so well defined in 
the southern areas, however, as it is in the Red- 
water field. 

Lithologic Interpretation of Gamma Ray Logs 

The gamma ray log does not, according 
to the literature, distinguish between limestone 
and dolomite when both are pure. It is very 
seldom, however, that the pure material is en¬ 
countered in the field. As shown in Figure 3-2, 
the gamma ray log will distinguish between a 
limestone and a dolomite formation. If one 
examines the logs of the three Redwater wells, 
one will see that the dolomite of the Nisku Member 
is more radioactive than the limestone of the 
Leduc member. 

In the Leduc sector of the southern area. 






- 55 - 


both these formations are dolomite, or extremely 
dolomitic, so the difference in the gamma ray 
deflection does not appear on the log. The 
Golden Spike reef is llmstone as at Redwater, and 
the Nisku is again more radioactive than the Leduc, 
although the difference in deflection is not so 
prominent here. 

Although no attempt is made to show 
structure in Figure 3-2, the well spacing and sea 
level datum being ignored, it is obvious that the 
section thickens to the south and west. Golden 
Spike No. 5, the well furthest west, shows the 
greatest thicknesses of Nisku, Ireton and Calmar, 
of all the wells shown. 

Summary and Conclusions 

From the foregoing discussion one must 
conclude that the gamma ray log can be extremely 
valuable in both short and long range correlation 
work. Within a limited area, such as an oil field, 
they can be used to build up a very complete 
picture of the lithologic changes within form- 
ational units. From a study of these changes the 
sedimentation of an area may be worked out in detail. 

Over greater distances formations can 
be correlated by means of the gamma ray log. if 
sufficient numbers of logs are available, the 




- 56 - 


sedimentation of larger areas may be studied. 

Even without detailed log coverage the lithologic 
changes of a large area can be traced, and from this 
knowledge of formation character may be increased. 

With sufficient experience in interpreting 
the logs, the actual lithology of the formations 
can be accurately and quickly described without the 
benefit of core or bit cutting samples.

PART FOUR 

NEUTRON WELL LOGGING 

Introduction 

The primary topic of this thesis is the 
natural radioactivity of sediments and its response 
on the gamma ray log. The writer, however, be¬ 
lieves some mention should be made of the arti¬ 
ficially induced radioactivity, and of its app¬ 
lication to oil field porosity investigation. The 
process is known as neutron logging. 

Instrumentation 

The neutron curve is obtained through 
the use of an Instrument very similar to that 
described for the gamma ray curve. The ionization 
chamber, however, is shortened from three feet to 
nine inches in length, and an appropriately shielded 
radium-beryllium neutron source is placed beneath 
the chamber, (4). Neutrons from the source bombard 
the earth material immediately surrounding the well 
bore, and the effect of this bombardment is meas¬ 
ured by the Ionization chamber. The source is of 
sufficient strength so that the gamma rays it in¬ 
duces in the rocks are of greater intensity than 
the natural gamma rays being emitted from the form - 
ations due to their radioactive elements. This 




.

. 

. 

. 
































■ 










- 58 - 


permits the measurement of the induced radiations 
without interference from the weaker natural ones. 
The shortening of the ionization chamber assists 
this by making it less sensitive to the rocks’ 
natural radioactivity. 

Theory of i\ieutron Logging 

The development of neutron logging is 
based on the theory that neutrons are present in 
the atomic nuclei of all elements except hydrogen. 
The neutrons generated by the radium-beryllium, 
source have very high original velocities and are 
called fast neutrons. In the strata surrounding 
the well bore they may be considered as under¬ 
going two processes, reduction in velocity, and 
capture. Many elements have the ability to cap¬ 
ture neutrons. In the capture process a neutron 
is taken into an atomic nucleus and, in the energy 
rebalance, bursts of gamma radiation may be emitted. 
It is these artificially stimulated gamma rays 
which are measured by the ionization chamber of 
the neutron instrument. 

Since they carry no electrical charge, 
neutrons will collide readily with atomic nuclei 
in their paths. As a result of these collisions 
their velocity is reduced. The hydrogen nucleus

- 59 - 


has a mass closely approximating that of the neutron, 
so hydrogen is the most important factor in reducing 
its velocity. Where hydrogen exists in the form¬ 
ation, the neutrons are slowed up near the source. 
This greatly reduces the number of neutrons avail¬ 
able for capture near the ionization chamber. The 
resultant decrease in the gamma rays produced by 
the rocks is recorded by the ionization chamber. 

The neutron log might, therefore, be thought of as 
a log of the hydrogen content of rocks, as it has 
been shown (4) that the hydrogen effect controls 
the outline of the log curve. It will be noted 
that reference has been made only to hydrogen, 
and nothing has been said about its manner of 
occurrence. It makes no difference whether the 
hydrogen is combined with carbon as oil, with 
oxygen as water in a brine filling the rock pores, 
or whether it is present in absorbed water in a 
shale, or chemically combined water in limonite 
or gypsum. What is recognized is solely the effect 
of the hydrogen itself. 

Since the hydrogen is almost always in 
fluids, the neutron log is a measurement of the 
amount of fluid surrounding the instrument. The 
fluid may be considered as being of two types: 









* 


• . 

. 









f* 


' 









.... . 













- 60 - 


that contained within the borehole, and the fluid 
present in any form within the formations* 

The amount of borehole fluid surrounding 
the instrument normally remains constant, except 
at points such as the change in bore hole diameter 
and fluid level. It therefore has a negligible 
influence on the formation fluid's response of 
the neutron curve. 

The formation fluid exerts the greatest 
influence on the neutron log. The behavior of the 
curve is such that the greater the amount of fluid, 
the lower the intensity of the curve. Thus the 
neutron log reflects the porosities of fluid-filled 
rocks, and not their permeabilities. 

Shales, in general, contain the greatest 
amount of total fluid, and therefore give the 
lowest intensity values. Non productive lime¬ 
stones and dolomites contain very little, if any, 
fluid, and therefore record the highest radiation 
intensities• 

Porosity Evaluations 

Quantitative porosity evaluation of the 
neutron curve is a relatively recent development 
initiated in 1949. Before this, the curve had been 
























: s -'. -v\-i'V ■\ 






- 61 - 


used purely as a qualitative indication of the 
presence of fluid. The procedure used in developing 
the quantitative porosity determinations is re¬ 
latively new, the study having been initiated 
between 1945 and 1949. The general procedure 
used is the same in most cases; however the methods 
and scales developed are confined to the area for 
which the work is done. Thus evaluation scales 
have been worked out for West Texas (2), Louis¬ 
iana (3), and the Redwater Oil Field of Alberta. 
Porosity Evaluation at Redwater: 

The method of porosity evaluation outlined 
below has been worked out for the Redwater Oil 
Field, (7). The writer understands that some mod¬ 
ifications have been evolved since it appeared, 
but as yet these have not been published. 

The evaluation procedure is based on two 

concepts: 

1. The neutron curve response is a function 
of formation fluid content. 

2. The formation fluid content is a 
function of porosity. 

The validity of these concepts has been 
demonstrated in the curve evaluation procedure of 
other areas, (3). 



- 62 - 


The first step in the procedure is the 
determining of a base line on the log which is 
constant throughout the field. Prom this line 
all the other measurements are made. It has been 
found that the minimum values of the Ireton curve 
response are sufficiently constant to provide a 
reference. A vertical line through these points 
is projected down through the producing horizon 
(the Leduc Member) and is used as the reference 
line on which to base the evaluation scale. 

The basic neutron evaluation scale is 
derived by using the figures obtained from a cored 
well on which a neutron log has been run. The 
percentage porosity of the core, obtained by core 
analyses, and averaged over two foot intervals, 
is plotted against the horizontal movement of the 
neutron curve pen, divided into suitable units. 

In Redwater the units chosen are inches of pen 
travel. The resultant graph is a smooth symmet¬ 
rical curve with the majority of points falling 
right on the line. The maximum and minimum por¬ 
osity values found for the initial well were 19 
and 1.5 per cent, and figures beyond this range 
must be obtained by extrapolating the curve. The 
porosity evaluation scale is derived directly from 
the above graph by reading the percentage porosity

values at points on the curve established by 
intersecting lines drawn from the units of pen 
travel. 

The scale has been used to check the 
porosities of many wells, the cores of which have 
been subsequently analysed. It has been found 
to be within 0.6 to 1 per cent of the values 
obtained by core analyses. 

The authors of the scale state that, 
with certain limitations, the method may be 
applied to any field. This is not proved as yet; 
however it is very successful in the Redwater field, 
and has been adopted by many companies.
